            <h3>Introduction to APEGBC report for competency in Canada and what this means</h3>
            
            <p>British Columbia in Canada has Association of Professional Engineering and Geoscientists (APEGBC) which allows training engineers to apply in Canada and has introduced a latest process. The Association provides competitive competency report writing assessment methods for enhancing the proficiency of the P.Eng designation in Canada. There are certain necessities of APEGBC that are required to be sustained by the engineering competency assessment system of writing. The association ensures that these assessments help to need the interest of the public while on the other hand being reliable, reasonable and organized in the registration process.</p>
            
            <h4>Writing a Professional Engineering Competency Assessment under APEGBC</h4>
            
            <p>It can be defined as the capabilities necessary to achieve given responsibilities and tasks acknowledged by the communities and the employees in the industry which meets the projected standards. The Competency assessment that is held by APEGBC requires work-related capabilities and experiences accompanied by intense details which are necessary to be present in professional engineers, which reflects practices that are effective and safe in nature. In contrary, to write lengthy experience report the new process only requires their engineers to fill their competencies in a more dynamic order based on the following criteria.</p>
			<ul class="wewre">
			<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i> Personal continuing professional development (CPD)</li> 
			<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i> Economic social and environmental continuity</li>

			</ul>
			
            <h3>APEGBC competency assessment requirements</h3>
			<p>Engineers who would be applying for the assessment required to present engineering skills and capabilities which are necessary for handling critical situations that arise under natural circumstances to the APEGBC. Examples that highlight their capabilities and knowledge are also required to be mentioned in the competency assessment.
