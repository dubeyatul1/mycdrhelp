           <h3>APEGS Work Experience Reporting</h3>
<p>Firstly make sure to go through the reporting guidelines thoroughly before beginning the work experience submission. This would greatly enhance the chances of success and therefore avoid the hassle of rejection. </p>
<p><b>For instructions and guidelines on experience reporting :-</b></p>
<p><b>Note&nbsp;1: </b>registered members-in-training and member-in-training applicants (international applicants), assigned with confirmatory exams, can commence with the experience reporting. </p>
<p><b>Note&nbsp; 2: </b>If you have experience as a professional engineer in the United States and also have NCEES record, your NCEES record will be sufficient for experience reporting. This means, your NCEES record would be enough for the APEGS form submission, no experience report would be needed in this case. </p>
<p>Results of experience review are never provided over phone, it is provided over email whenever they are ready. Please do not contact the APEGS office for the results. It would take 1 to 3 months for reviewing the experience report and if there is any problem regarding the report, you will be contacted. </p>
