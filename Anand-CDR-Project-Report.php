<h3>1.1 GENERAL</h3>
<p>The Periyar Valley Irrigation Project envisages the utilization of controlled releases from the Ennakkal Dam, being constructed across the Edamalayar, one of the tributaries of Periyar River.  The dam was designed to have a live storage of 1017.8 mm³ and was utilized for various purposes such as irrigation, power production, salinity control, industrial and domestic uses and navigation.  The release pattern of the reservoir was based on irrigation and other allied requirements.  The controlled release would be interrupted by the Periyar barrage at Bhoothathankettu with suitable modification and diverted through the main canal to cater to the irrigation  needs to 32800 ha of lands lying on the left bank of the Periyar.  The project aimed in the raising of additional crops in an area of 20,000 ha.  The agricultural land is spread over the six Thaluks of Ernakulam district viz. Kothamangalam,. Moovattupuzha, Kunnathunadu, Aluva, Parur and Kanayannur.  This is one of the very few projects in the State which maintains full reservoir level and can supply water to a large extent of ayacut area throughout the year.  The main component of Periyar Valley Irrigation Project includes:</p>
<ul class="list10">
     <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Periyar barrage at Bhoothathankettu</li>
	 <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Main canal</li>

	 <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Major distributaries</li>
	 <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Minor distributaries</li>
</ul>
<p>The sanction for the project was accorded by the Government of India in 1956 and was partially commissioned in 1967 to irrigate 25616 ha..  The scheme was revised in 1965 in order to extent the benefit of the project to a total extent of 32800 ha. of lands lying on left bank of Periyar by raising FRL to +34.95 m from +32.20 m.  this was to be achieved by raising the height of shutters at Bhoothathankettu and then building a High Level Canal at a higher elevation so as to command ayacut areas at higher attitude.  Work on the reversed scheme was carried on till late 1980’s and nearly 750 k.m. lengths of canals were completed.  </p>

<h3>1.2 SCOPE</h3>
<p>The scheme is the projected remedy for the shortage of water in the lower reaches of the river for various purposes such as irrigation, salinity control, industrial and domestic uses especially during the lean months of the year. </p>
<p>The major scope of Periyar Valley Irrigation Project is incorporated with  the irrigation of agricultural lands of Kerala.  The major portion of the agriculture land is constituted by rice which is the staple food of Kerala.  The production of rice faces great scarcity in the waster requirements during summer.  This leads to a vide gap between the production and the demand of rice requirements.  The Periyar Valley Irrigation Project benefits an area of 32800 ha. of lands.</p>
<p>Apart from the irrigation benefits both flow as well as lift the scheme will catter to the domestic and industrial needs, in addition to checking the ingress of salinity in the lower reaches of the river.  Saline water intrusion in to the river, which have their in to the see, is a common phenomenon occurring.  Salinity affects domestic and industrial water supply as well as irrigation.  Paddy cannot resist a saline concentration of above 2000 ppm. If the salinity concentration of water exceeds a critical values, it becomes unsuitable both for industrial and domestic conception.  The Periyar at its lower reaches is under the influences of tidal action and hence the problem of salinity in the river in acute.  Salinity intrusion can take place in two different ways: at the river mouth due to density currents, tidal action and molecular diffusion and also across the coast as ground water flow.  With the development of industries, growth of population and trade in the area, demand for good water also is on increase.  </p>
<p>The major industries in the region benefited by Periyar valley Irrigation Project are the Aluminium Factory, The Fertilizers and Chemicals Travancore Ltd., the Travancore Cochin Chemicals, The Appolo Tyre Factory, The Indian Rare Earths, The Travancore Rayons, Cominco Binani Zinc Factory, The Kochi Refineries Ltd., The Cochin Fertilizer Factory, Tile Factories, Fisheries and Textile Mills.</p>
<p>Periyar valley Irrigation Project also serves domestic as well as drinking purposes.  When there is full flow in the canal, due to seepage the wells in the surrounding lands gains rising the existing level of water and as a result it serves the drinking purposes of population residing.  The domestic use includes bathing, washing, lavatories etc.</p>
<p>Necessity of barrage:   The Periyar valley Irrigation Project was found inefficient to serve the large ayacut area proposed in the summer or in the lean months of the year.  In order to meet the required amount of water in these lean months, a fair amount of water is stored during the raining season which would be utilized later.  Moreover the heavy intensity of rainfall during the four months may cause floods in the river and consequent damage to the law lying areas whereas the other other part of the year the rainfall is not sufficient to meet the crop needs.  The only remedy to this problem is to have sufficient storage to be controlled and utilized during the different crop periods according to necessity.</p>

<h3>1.4 TOPOGRAPHY	</h3>
<p>The general topography of the area presents no drainage difficulties.  The numerous streams emptying in to the main river, affords enough scopes for letting out the drainage to flow in to the rivers.  As an anti-water-logging measures, the drainage courses in the fields are to be cleared annually and encroachments of drainage channels should be prevented.</p>
<h3>1.5 GEOLOGY</h3>
<p>The Project area may be divided in to four belts according to the various geological formations occurring in the region.  The belts are oriented more or less north south and consist of the following:</p>
<ul class="list10">
     <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>A belt of crystalline rocks of Archean groups.</li>
	 <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>A belt of residual laterite.</li>
	 <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>A narrow belt of Varkala beds of the tertiary groups.</li>
	 <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>The Western most belts of recent deposits </li>
</ul>

<p>The crystalline rocks of the Archean formation are made up of pink granite gneisses, Grey gneisses, and charnockites.  The charnockites show intrusive relationship with gneisses.  The later may be considered to be equivalent to the Penisular suite.  The residian laterite occurs as a belt towards the west of archean crystalline rocks.  The is the resultant product of in situ alteration of the crystalline rock.  These types of formations are predominant in Kunnathunadu, Kothamangalam and Muvattupuzha Taluks.</p>
<h3>1.6 NEED OF REVAMPING</h3>
<p><b>The need of revamping of periyar valley irrigation projects can be mentioned as below:</b></p>

<ul class="list10">
     <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>To investigate suitable means to provide the required water supply to ayacut area, equitably, reliably and timely; for increased sustained productivity from irrigated commands by rational and appropriate methods.</li>
	 <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>The revamping program needs measures to ensure water supply at field level up to tail end, measure to increase agricultural productivity at irrigated commands and measures to augment reservoir capacity.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>The revamping is done to overcome the losses which makes the scheme inefficient. The losses can be listed as below:</b></p>
 
<ul class="list10">
     <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Abnormal deviation from the canal design.</li>

<h3>1.8 Project area</h3>
<p>The main dam at Ennakal across the Idamalayar river is in Idukki district and is at latitude 10° 13’ 15” N and is at longitude 76º42’16”E. The periyar barrage is at latitude 10º8’16” N and longitude 76º40’00”E. The road bridge over the barrage connects the Ernakulam and Idukki districts. the nearest railway station is at Alwaye on the southern railway. The ayacut of the project is spread over the taluks of kothamangalam, muvattupuzha, kunnathanadu, alwaye, kanayannur and Parur taluks of Ernakulam district.the barrage is accessible by good motorable road from Alwaye railway station and important places like kothamangalam,muvattupuzha and perumbavoor .the head work is 52 km away from Alwaye railway station. the main canal ,distribution system and the ayacut area are all accessible by district and village roads. The national highway no. 47 runs through the ayacut area and crosses the Parur branch canal at Alwaye. The project area can be generally divided into 3 distinct groups as the mountainous forest areas, the thinly populated hill slopes, the heavily populated plains and the industrial belt around Cochin. Hills and valleys are the general features of the project area. There are vast stretches of low lying swamps in the area. The mountainous regions are made up of disintegrated rocks mixed with boulders and rock covered with a thin layer of loam. The hill slopes are all gravelly and contains a good percentage of laterite soil. The wet lands in the area are all composed of stiff clay. The climate in project area falls in line with the general climatic conditions of the state. There are two monsoon seasons in the area-the south west and north east, from June to September and October to December respectively. The summer is from January to May with few showers in April and May. The south west monsoon is very active in this area, when the area gets 75% of its annual rainfall. The temperature variation in the area is substantial.</p>
<h3>1.9 Historical development</h3>
<p>The settlement in this basin is believed to be very old. The pre-history of this region is shrouded in mystery. There is no clear evidence of the Paleolithic man having lived here. This region is rich in pre historic monuments which contain relics such as bones, stones and implements and pottery. The small size dolmens of megalithic monuments found at Vadattupara in Malayattur reserve forest deserves special attention.during1963, some relics of monolithic culture, believed to date back from 200 BC to first century AD were discovered from Kodanad in Kunnathunad taluk, while excavating the Kodanad branch canal under the scheme. the relics included a good number of terra cotta gigurines; pot sherds with engravings generally available in megalithic pottery were also unearthened at the site. All these tend to prove that early settlement in this basin took place along the sea coast and river banks. Project was sanctioned on 1956 for Rs 348 lakhs and construction was started during 1956 during 5 year plan. Construction of barrage started during 1958 and was completed in 1963.the project was declared of complete in 1992.total cost of project as on 31.03.200 was worked out to Rs100.5 Crores.  Ayacut achieved till March 2000 was 30489 hectares against the envisaged Ayacut of 32800 hectres of paddy.</p>

<h3>2.1 GENERAL</h3>
<p>Periyar Valley Irrigation Project in Ernakulam district is one of the largest Irrigation Project in the state.  The project was envisaged to meet the irrigation requirement of 32800 hectares of agricultural land spread over six thaluks of Ernakulam districts viz: Kothamangalam, Muvattupuzha, Kunnathunadu, Aluva, Parur and Kanayannur Taluks being supplemented with the tale race discharge of Edamalayar Hydro Electric Projects.  This is one of the very few projects in the state which maintains full reservoir level and supply water to a large extends of Ayacut area through out the year.  PVIP comprises of one barrage at Boothathankettu in Kothamangalam Taluk and main canal of length 8 KMtrs., low level canal 20.5 K.Mtrs., high level canal 23 K Mtrs. And a net work of branches and minors.  Irrigation was successfully carried out for about 20 years.  Due to constant rain and improper maintenance and upkeep of the distribution system, the conveyance efficiency has come down gradually.  Canal system unable to catch the demands of its beneficiaries.</p>
<p>Various studies were conducted in order to study the reasons of inefficiencies of the system</p>

<h4 style="font-size:20px;">2.2  STUDIES CONDUCTED</h3>
<h4 style="font-size:18px;">2.2.1 Public survey</h4>
<p>To study the response of the inhabitants of the surrounding area about the workability of the system and its usability, a public survey was conducted.  A data sheet was distributed among people involving details of schedules various uses of water, its portability and the maintenance and upkeep of the system.</p>
<p>This survey was conducted in selected places at Boothathankettu, Kothamangalam, Kodanad, Mulavoor, Perumbavoor, Kizhakkambalam, Alwaye, Kunjattukara, Keezhillam, Valakom, Irapuram, Kolencherry and Eruveli.</p>
<p>From the analysis of the filled up data sheet, it was found that the system was lacking proper maintenance and that there was inadequacy in the amount of water to meet the necessary requirement. </p>
<h4 style="font-size:18px;">2.2.2 Discharge study</h4>
<p>A detailed discharge study was conducted in order to estimate the losses which contributed to the inefficiency of the system.  The discharge was calculated from the area velocity formula i.e.</p>
<center><span style="background:#d3d3d3;"><b>Q = AV</b></span></center>
<p>Where, </p>
<p>Q - discharge in m³ /s or Cumecs </p>
<p>A - cross sectional area in m2 </p>
<p>V - Velocity in m/s</p>
<p><b>Area: </b></p>
<p>The area of cross section depends on the considered section of the canal.  The depth of flow of water and the top width was taken from the respective canal sections.  If the canal system considered if a rectangular one then area can be formulated as </p>
<center><span style="background:#d3d3d3;"><b>A = BY</b></span></center>
<p>Where ,</p>
<p>A - area in m2  </p>
<p>B - bed with in meter</p>
<p>Y - depth of flow in meter.</p>
<p><b>If the canal system considered is a trapezoidal section then area can Abe given as  </b></p>
<p>Where, </p>
<p>A - area in m2 </p>
<p>B - Bed width in meter</p>
<p>Y - depth of flow in meter</p>
<p><b>In the case of rectangular section, the bed width is directly obtained from the measure of the top width of the respective sections.  Where as in the case of a trapezoidal section, the bed width is calculated from </b></p>
<center><span style="background:#d3d3d3;"><b>T = B + 2 ZY</b></span></center>
<p>Where,</p>
<p>T - top width in meter</p>
<p>B - bed width in meter</p>
<p>Z - side slope </p>
<p>Y - depth of flow in meter</p>
<p><b>Velocity: </b></p>

<p>The velocity is minimum at centre and decreases towards sides.  For measuring the velocity in the channel section a straight and well defined reach of the channel section should be selected.  The side should also be free from disturbing influence of hydraulic structures.  The velocity is measured by the following methods:</p>
<ul class="list10">
     <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Surface floats </li>
	 <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Sub surface floats</li>
	 <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Twin floats</li>
	 <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Velocity rod or floats</li>
	 <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Current meter</li>
	 <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Pitot tube</li>
</ol>
<p>Among these the surface float method is found to be suitable at site.  Hence  this was adopted.</p>
<h3>Surface float method:</h3>
<p>Surface floats are made of light material such as Corks or hollow wooden blocks so that they may float on the surface.  They are painted on top and some times attached with a flag to easily distinguish it from any other floating object.  </p>
<p>Two wire ropes are stretched across the channel section one at the beginning and other at the end of the selected reach for conducting the test.  This distance is called test reach.  A third rope is stretched upstream of the test reach by 15 to 20 m.  All the three ropes are marked at various points so as to divide the channel with in various compartments, the centre line of which defines the part of track for the floats.  The floats are dropped in water along various paths near the third rope.  They acquire uniform velocity by the time they enter the test reach.  The time of travel of the test reach of only those floats which follow their correct track is recorded.</p>
