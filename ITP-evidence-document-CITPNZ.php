                <h3>CHARTERED IT PROFESSIONAL NEW ZEALAND</h3>  
                <h4 style="font-size:18px;">IT professionals Evidence documents required by Chartered IT Professionals New Zealand (CITPNZ)</h4> 
                <p>IT professionals, who have successfully submitted their residence application, are put on fast track approval of their ITP evidence documents. As requested by Visa Officers “A certified letter is thus issued from the IT professionals of New Zealand that clearly states that the degree and further learning meets the standard qualifications towards CITPNZ status. However, a qualification level of 7 is required at NZQF initially”</p> 
                <h3>Standards of education required for CITPNZ</h3> 
                <p>CITPNZ provides a confirmation service. They assess the present education qualification and compare it with the benchmark academic requirements set by CITPNZ.</p> 
                <p><strong>A guide with more details can be downloaded , or an application for ITP Qualification Recognition can be done.</strong></p>
                <p>However, one needs to keep in mind that this is merely an assessment to check if the individual qualifications match the benchmark educational requirements of CITPNZ. Neither this is a full-fledged test conducted by the CITPNZ, nor is it an assessment of basic skills. In order to get a full certification from the CITPNZ, one needs to go for a full assessment details.</p>
                <h3>Why is it necessary for an individual to undertake the IT Professional Qualification Recognition process?</h3>
                <p>This process is necessary when</p>
                <ul class="wewre">
                 <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> During your visa application, the NZQA or New Zealand immigration asks for this. </li>
                <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> You are interested to know what level your present educational qualification, or your base qualification or your subsequent level of learning compared to the standards of New Zealand's enterprise assumptions. (as per the CITPNZ standard obligations)</li>
                <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> A company with the intentions to hire or educational institution might ask you to go through the assessment in order to see how your educational qualification and subsequent learning matches up to the standards set by the CITPNZ. </li>

                      <h3>Required Qualifications</h3>
                      <p>In order to meet the standards of requirements set by the CITPNZ, one must have the following qualifications-</p>
                      <ul class="list10">
                        <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>You need to have a NZQF level of 7 or higher</li>
                        <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>If you have combined your subsequent learning, then that should meet the required content benchmark set by the CITPNZ</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>A minimum requirement of level 7 or beyond is required on the New Zealand Qualifications framework if you are planning to take this assessment for the purpose of immigrating into New Zealand. Level 7 or above qualification is equal to a New Zealand's bachelor degree. There is no necessity that your field of knowledge has to strictly be based on Computer and IT degree. However, it needs to be relevant to the field of technology and the rest of the qualifications can be met by the subsequent learning process.</p>
                      <p>or instance, if an individual holds a degree in advanced mathematics, which is applicable but does not directly focus on Computing or IT, this scenario can be considered. However, added IT related knowledge that might be sufficient or supportive and has the evidence that the degree has been used in technological context can be viable for this. For an example: Machine learning would in all probabilities follow the standard requirements. Nonetheless, the degree on its own is not sufficient, additional knowledge or subsequent learning is essential.</p>
                      <p><strong>Detailed description can be found in the Qualification Recognition Guide 11</strong></p>

                       <p>The New Zealand qualifications authority or NZQA is the body that is responsible for assessing your overseas qualifications and thus compares it to the NZ Qualification framework for determining your Level. In order to take the qualification process, one needs to meet some basic requirements.</p>

                        <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> If the person is from another country and is on NZQA’s list of qualifications then there can be exempt from assessment</li>

                      <p>Please keep in mind that the content assessment process by us cannot be proceeded with until one of these requirements are met. Now, if you are looking to go for NZQA or IQZ, then that should be done before the Qualification recognition process.</p>
