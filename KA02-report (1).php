                  <p>Engineers, who are willing to migrate to New Zealand, are required to submit the KA02 report for the assessment of their knowledge to the concerned body known as Engineering New Zealand, previously known as IPENZ. Engineering New Zealand is an organization, which is bestowed with responsibility of assessing the skills of applicants. However, the KA02 report/ Knowledge Assessment report needs to be submitted by those who do not have necessary ICT skills specified by the IPENZ and mainly hails from the non-ICT field. KA02 report helps the applicants to showcase their ICT skills to the IPENZ and compete with best engineers in similar roles. </p>
				  
				  
				  <p>It has been a perpetual dream for almost everyone out there for working offshore. However, very few actually get the opportunity to get the same. This is not just the failure of qualifications, but can also be the way of presenting the KA02 report. KA02 stands for Knowledge Assessment 2 Report, which is a technical report of  the methodical application of a report presented to the Engineering New Zealand or (IPENZ) for the visa process. This process would let people apply for the visa for skilled migration process for ICT professionals. </p>
				  
				  <p>There are two types of reports that can be submitted to the IPENZ for engineering jobs in New Zealand. These are KA01 and KA02 reports. Applicants hailing with a degree from Washington accord affiliated colleges need to submit a KA01 report to the Engineering New Zealand (ENZ). However candidates, who does not have a degree from colleges accredited by the Washington Accord, need to submit a KA02 report to avail jobs in the same field in New Zealand. </p>
			
				  
				  <p>You would be happy to know that New Zealand has observed an exponential growth of jobs and hence garnered attention from all over the world. It is evident that ENZ gets a plethora of applications from the applicants. Unfortunately, most of the candidates and their applications get rejected due to improper or unsatisfactory KA01 and KA02 Knowledge Assessment reports. To be honest, the reports have hefty requirements and applicants must have impeccable sense of English and grammar. Moreover, it needs proper knowledge to craft a KA02 report and they must list their skills in such a manner that it helps to make them stand out in the crowd. It is thus highly recommended that professional help should be taken in this matter. Our experts are highly proficient and skilled in mentioning the skills properly and have impeccable knowledge of grammar as well as KA02 requirements. Our professionals not only have a positive history of crafting high quality KA02 report, but also have provided reports which have 100% approval rate. </p>

					<h3>Engineering New Zealand Knowledge Assessment Report Types</h3>
					
                    <p>There are generally two kinds of assessments that are knowledge-based and are submitted accordingly for New Zealand skilled migration. The applicants can submit any of the two reports mentioned below according to their work experience and skills.</p>
					 
					 <ul class="list10">
						<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>If the candidate has done a graduation degree from the university that is generally equal to the standard and qualification of New Zealand, or from the other universities of Washington Accord needs to submit the KAO2 report to IPENZ.
						<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>The applicants who have graduated from the university which is non affiliated to Washington Accord, then also the applicant needs to submit the KA02 report to the IPENZ.
					</ul>
					 
					 
					<p>It can be said that knowledge assessment KA02 Report is crucial for those engineers who have graduated from non accredited countries and also want to migrate to New Zealand. The IPENZ generally assesses that the skills are based on specific qualifications and also in experiencing the discipline of engineering life.  There are different individuals who apply for New Zealand skilled migration but are not qualified because they do not possess a proper educational background. It can also be said that writing report of KA02 requires a highly skilled and in-depth knowledge of engineering. </p>

				<h3>Classes of Recognition</h3>
				
					<p class="para">You can be surveyed as an engineering professional, designing technologist, designing professional or engineering geologist relying upon your capability and designing knowledge.  </p>
					
					<p class="para">Each extraordinary class of acknowledgment is benchmarked to a universally perceived capability standard – Washington Accord, Sydney Accord and Dublin Accord – and are likewise separated by multifaceted nature (ipe.nz/unpredictability).</p> 
					
					<p class="para">Every one of our Registers and IPENZ Memberships require explicit abilities and capabilities:</p>
					
					<h4>Engineering Professional</h4>
					
					<p>On the off chance that you need to be evaluated for CPEng, IntPE(NZ) and additionally MIPENZ, you'll need a Washington Accord certify capability or have the capacity to demonstrate you've picked up the proportional dimension of learning. You'll have to indicate you can manage complex engineering issues and complete complex engineering exercises.</p> 
					
					<p>Engineering Technologist If you need to be surveyed for ETPract, IntET(NZ) as well as TIPENZ, you'll need a Sydney Accord certify capability or have the capacity to demonstrate you've picked up the equal dimension of information. You'll have to demonstrate you can manage comprehensively characterized designing issues and complete extensively characterized engineering exercises.</p> 
					
					<h4>Engineering Technologist </h4>
					<p>In the event that you need to be evaluated for CertEtn as well as AIPENZ, you'll need a Dublin Accord authorize capability or have the capacity to indicate you've picked up the equal dimension of information. You'll have to indicate you can manage very much characterized designing issues and do all around characterized engineering exercises. </p>
					
                    <h4>Engineering Geologist </h4>
					<p>On the off chance that you need to be surveyed for Peng Geol, you're in charge of foreseeing the idea of the ground and frequently work intimately with geotechnical engineers. You'll need a geology degree at the honours level, a postgraduate qualification in engineering geology or demonstrating equivalent knowledge. </p>
					
                    <h4>Kinds of Assessment</h4>

In your Knowledge Assessment, you'll have to indicate you have a dimension of specialized information and comprehension increased through your work and realizing which is identical to a science certificate certify under the Washington Accord. In the event that your Knowledge Assessment is effective, you would then be able to finish an appraisal for Initial Registration. </p>
					<p>The key distinction between competence-based Membership and Registration is the recurrence of the appraisal. Capability based Membership appraisals are a one-time procedure to perceive fitness for designing practice. </p>
					<p>To stay Registered, you have to participate in a continuous reassessment process, at any rate once at regular intervals, to demonstrate your proceeded with skill. </p>
					
					
					<h3>Understanding the Assessment Process  </h3>
