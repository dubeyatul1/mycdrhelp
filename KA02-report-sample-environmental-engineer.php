                          <h2>Objective of the Project</h2>
                          <p>I completed my project under the guidance of Assistant Professor Shakti Kumar. Leachate was tested for various parameters like concentration of Chlorides, Sulphates, Chemical oxygen Demand (COD) and pH using methods given in “Standard Methods for Examination of water and waste water” published by “American Public health Association”. One stage distillation was done on Landfill Leachate sample to study the changes in Leachate quality parameters.</p>
                          <p>For examining two stages distillation process, the distillate from the stage one was used as feed to the second stage. With this I have compared the changes that have occurred in Quality parameters of Landfill Leachate before and after the treatment of one sage and two stage distillation of landfill leachate. The effect of landfill Leachate on the Ground water Quality was also studied.</p>

                          <h2>Background</h2>
                          <p>Federal university of ABC is a renowned Brazilian institution with most part of the academic body holding Ph.D.</p>
                          <p> It was recognized as the unique Brazilian University with impact factor in scientific publications above average according to SCImago Institutions Rankings (Source: http://www.scimagoir.com/). The university and the engineering courses were created in 2005.</p>
                          <p>The project was the last requirement to get my engineering diploma. I was appointed as team lead engineer for this project. After an intense research, I found a lack in the Brazilian market, where there was not any electronic device able to automatically, with good accuracy and repeatability, prepare some chemical process like chemical solution dilution in a reasonable price/amount for a small company or laboratory.</p>

Before the start of the Power production it was important that we have an up to date new potable water treatment plant in order to fulfil the requirements of the drinking water for the staff and the colony of people working in the power plant. I calculated that 40 m3/hr Potable water treatment plants will be required for the potable water requirement of the power plant staff and the colony.

                          <h2>Background</h2>
                          <p>In the year 2015 Uttar Pradesh Rajya Vidyut Utpadan Nugam Limited floated the tender for the construction of 2x660 MW “Jawaharpur Super thermal Power Plant”, Uttar Pradesh, India. Doosan decided to make the Bid for this project. I was tasked to prepare the technical proposal and basic design was assigned to water treatment section. I was selected by my Team Head as responsible engineer to prepare the technical proposal and to carry out the basic design (in case Doosan wins the Project). In the year 2016 Doosan won the multimillion dollar project. I carried out work related to Technical proposal making and thereafter and basic design for 4500 m3/hr Pretreatment Plant (PT) Plant, 80m3/hr. Demineralization Plant (DM), and 250 m3/hr waste water treatment Plant.</p>

                          <p>I worked as responsible Engineer for the Technical proposal making and Basic design for Pretreatment (PT), Demineralization Plant (DM) and waste water treatment Plants (WWTP) for 2x660 MW “Jawaharpur Super thermal Power Plant”, Uttar Pradesh, India. Responsibilities included calculating Pre-treatment water, Demineralized water, waste water requirements including Basic design, Detailed design review, selection of vendor for supply of package items, finalization of specification of process equipment, process design and submission of preliminary documents to owner. I also interacted with Electrical, I&C, architectural and Procurement teams for carrying out the associated activates of the Package items.</p>
                          <p>Detailed engineering was done by Doosan’s Indian subsidy (Doosan Power system India). As a responsible engineer of Head office for water Treatment section, I also have the responsibility of the detailed design review to check for any technical issues and to avoid any cost impact to the company. I have the responsibility to report to head of engineering that this project will be completed on time without any delay.</p>
