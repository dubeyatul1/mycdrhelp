                          <h2>Background</h2>
                          <p>Lamprell Engineering & Construction (“E&C”) delivers fully integrated engineering solutions to the onshore and offshore oil & gas and renewable energy sectors. Lamprell E&C offers a full scope of services from early production to delivery and beyond, extending to all areas of onshore and offshore design and construction. The division is organized to deliver through the full project life cycle in the UAE, GCC, North Africa and beyond.</p>
                          <p>Horizon Emirates Jebel Ali Petroleum Terminal (HEJP) operates a Petroleum Products Storage Terminal inside JAFZA, UAE. The Terminal contains Jet Fuel Storage Tanks, Pumping and Filtration facilities, Truck Loading facilities, connection to Berths, Utilities, etc.</p>
                          <p>The facilities were commissioned in 2014 and to augment the operating efficiency and safety, some Punch-List works were required to be carried out in the operating facilities. The proposed work scope involved Civil, Mechanical, Electrical and Instrumentation disciplines. The Works Location was spread inside the terminal and Oil Tanker Berth areas.</p>
                          <p>Proposed project schedule by Lamprell was 17 months; however, client (HJATL) requested for 12-month project schedule in order to minimize the plant shutdown works. I was responsible to execute the mechanical scope of the task and the short time frame was intimidating. I was appointed as Lead Engineer for engineering, design, testing, supply and commissioning support of rotating mechanical equipment.</p>

                          <p>ENOC/HJATL awarded this job with project completion duration of 12 months. This project required involvement from all disciplines and strong coordination. Since the budgeted man-hours was minimal most of the engineers involved were shared resources i.e., it was expected to work simultaneously in other projects as well. All the engineering work was expected to be accomplished to the satisfaction of third party inspection agency which was Bureau Veritas.</p>
                          <p>My role mainly included identification of scope, preparation of all the technical requirements, estimate man-hours and co-ordination with site and purchase team. Apart from the above I was also responsible to resolve any engineering, production, installation and commissioning and troubleshooting issues. I was the single point contact for all concerns related to mechanical equipment.</p>

                          <p>The ASV is a MLT 116C self-elevating accommodation unit, of modern and field-proven design with a year-round 91.5 m (300 feet) water depth capability in a harsh environment. The ASV has three sets of rack and pinion type jacking systems. The main hull consisted of a tank bottom, machinery deck, main deck, level 1-5 accommodation and helicopter-deck. Enclosed in the hull structure will be the machinery rooms, auxiliary machinery rooms, workshops, stores and control room. All liquid storage will be within the hull structure. The ASV, including its machinery and equipment, was to be upgraded and built under the special survey and inspection of the Classification Society American Bureau of Shipping (ABS).</p>

                          <p>Client, Millennium Offshore Services (MOS) awarded a fast track contract to upgrade the Accommodation Support Vessel. As per the contract schedule the duration to complete the project was 290 days which was a challenging task to accomplish. A construction specification was issued which described the scope of construction, outfitting, equipment, machinery and electrical installation of the conversion of an existing three-legged offshore jack-up drilling unit to an offshore Jack-Up Accommodation Support Vessel. The ASV including its machinery and equipment was required to be built under the special survey and inspection of the Classification Society.</p>

I was pursuing my final semester in the stream of Mechanical Engineering. For being awarded the degree of Bachelor of Engineering, I had to complete a project work prescribed as one of the academic requirements by the university. The project work was titled as “Automated Filling Unit”.</p>

                          <p>The objective was to develop an automated filling mechanism consisting of the conveyor unit which operates with the help of a DC motor. The bottles were lined over this unit. As a bottle takes position below the nozzle the motor is stopped using the driver circuit and microcontroller. The next instant nozzle moves down with the help of certain mechanism attached to stepper motor. When the tip of the nozzle reaches the bottom of the bottle, the stepper motor is stopped and starts running in opposite direction with a set speed based on the feed rate. Coeval to this, pump motor is switched on for a particular period and then switched off. This shall be done using a timer. Once the filling is complete the stepper motor starts running at a higher speed to move the nozzle to the higher end. Once the higher end is reached the stepper motor is stopped and the conveyor motor starts and the next bottle is brought in line. This cycle repeats, the basic block diagram of the bottle filling machine is shown below:</p>

                          <p>The automated filling mechanism project entailed designing of motor operated conveyor unit, bi-directional motor driven recirculating ball screw and nut assembly which carried the filling nozzle. This nozzle was connected to a motor driven gear pump. All these units were controlled by a timer and multiple limit switches.</p>
