                  <h3>CPD : Objective</h3>
				  <p>CPD activities are designed to update your knowledge, skill or judgement in your area(s) of practice so that academic and practical qualifications do not become outdated and it allowed individual to update skills regardless of occupation and age.  CPD enables you to enhance your competency like -</p>
				  <ul class="list10">
					<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Helped to maintain technical competence
					<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Enhance your effectiveness in the workplace
					<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Helped to develop leadership qualities
					<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Be able to help, influence

					<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Better serve the community.
				  </ul>
				  <h3>Requirements</h3>

		         <p>Chartered Professional Engineers, Engineering Technologists and Chartered Engineering Associates should be aware of the obligation to meet CPD policy.</p>

				<p><b>Minimum requirement -</b></p>

				<p>Your CPD records must contain a document of minimum 150 hours of structured CPD which contain information of your career for 3 years</p>

				<h3>Specific requirements</h3>

				<p>For all practitioners, of the 150 hours:</p>
				<ul class="list10">
				<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>It should contain at least 50 hours that relate to your area(s) of practice
				<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>It should contain at least 10 hours that relate to cover risk management skills learned through your career
				<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>It should contain at least 15 hours that must address business and management skills
				<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>The rest must cover a range of activities that are relevant to your career and interests.
				</ul>

				<p>Practitioners like engineering, academics and teachers must demonstrate at least 40 hours along with 150 hours which showcase their industry involvement in any three-year period. The industry involvement can be considered as an additional requirement or main part in your CPD. It depends upon whether it satisfied CPD criteria or not. </p>

				<h3>Keeping CPD records online</h3>

				<p>Today eCPD record is easily accessible through my portal and helped the members to record their structured CPD by allocating hours in relevant categories. The summary of CPD represents different skills like Risk Management, Business and Management and Related Area(s) of Practice.</p>
				<h3>CPD for multiple colleges</h3>
				<p>If you have more than one area of practice, you have to record at least 50 hours for each area. For example, if you are in the civil and structural colleges, you have to record 50 hours for Civil and 50 hours for Structural. If some technical CPD activities may overlap, then these technical activities can be labelled as both civil-related and Structural-related CPD.</p>
				<p>The diagram below illustrates a situation where 15 hours are considered ‘both civil and Structural.' This would require an additional minimum of 35 hours for Structural and an additional 35 hours for Civil to meet the requirement of 50 hours in each area of +/practice.</p>

				<br/>
				<h3>Career break provision</h3>
				<p>The CPD requirements are more flexible as it considered career break like chartered members who have been on a career break of at least six months during the three year period. Such members can complete 150 hours of CPD over five years in spite of the three years.</p>
				<p>A person career break is considered  if he or she has a period of leave from the workforce of at least 6 months but less than 5 years for proper cause. <br/></p><p><b>To avoid uncertainty, the following may be proper causes:</b></p>
			   <ul class="list10">
				<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>A serious illness;</li>
				<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Parental leave;</li>
				<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Extended Travel;</li>
				<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Caring for family members;</li>
				<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Involuntary unemployment; or</li>
				<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Elite sporting or cultural pursuits.</li>
			   </ul>
				<p><b>Note: </b>The permanent part-time engineering work, voluntary engineering work, work-related study, retirement, semi-retirement are not proper cause.</p>
				<h3>Applying for Chartered Status.</h3>
				<ul class="list10">
				<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>A minimum of 150 hours of CPD over the three year period up to the date of the Chartered application.</li>
				<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>If you are trying to achieve chartered status directly through the Engineering Competency Report (ECR) Pathway, the Professional Development Program (PDP) Pathway, or the Mature Experienced Engineers (MEE) Pathway, you must have CPD of 150 hours over the last three years.</li>
				<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA) is another pathway; it considers either records of 150 hours of CPD over the last three years or you may be expected to present your current CPD records.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>CPD types</h3>
				<p><b>CPD </b>activities have been classified into various types like any tertiary course taken, short course, learning activities in the workplace, private study, service to engineering profession, the preparation and presentation of material of course, academic research and any other activities that meet objective of CPD policy. </p>

				<p><b>Can I count learning activities in the workplace towards my CPD?</b></p>

				<p>Activities which do not extend your knowledge cannot be claimed as learning activities in the workplace. For any learning activity undertaken in the workplace it must demonstrate how it has extended your knowledge for CPD consideration. A maximum of 75 hours of your total CPD in any three-year period can be claimed for the above activities.</p>

				<p><b>Do non-award courses count towards CPD?</b></p>

				<p>Yes. Individual tertiary course units not undertaken for award purposes still count towards CPD.</p>

				<p><b>Does mentoring other engineers count towards CPD?</b></p>

				<p>Yes. It can count towards CPD in accordance with the requirements set down relating to service to the profession</p>

				<p><b>Does my CPD have to be obtained through Engineers Australia?</b></p>

				<p>No. You can source your CPD through any channel but there is value in sourcing through the various Engineers Australia channels.</p>
	
				<p><b>Does post graduate study count towards CPD?</b></p>

			<p>Yes. Study whether on campus or by distance education can count. There is no limit to the maximum number of hours that you can state over a three-year period for the above activities. For distance education, estimate the equivalent number of hours of formal face-to-face education must consider. But the time which was claimed must be the actual hours of lectures/tutorials/laboratory work, which was spent both in preparation and/or follow-up. All such activities will involve some form of assessment.</p>
