                        <p>For the unit title “Managing Project Quality”, I reviewed the learning outcome and noted that the duties which I performed during my job as Project Manager at “ABC Company” were same as that of the learning outcome. My duties mainly preparing and recommending proposals to update or change methods and procedures, workflows, job functions and resolve project as well as organizational  issues.</p> 
						
						<h4 class="kao">Analyze project quality issues in various project settings</h4>
						<p><b>Situation -</b> As a Project Manager at ABC Company, I was also responsible to evaluate project issues and sorted them accordingly whenever required.</p>
						<p><b>Task –</b> I was required to assess the organizational readiness for alteration as well as identifying and analyzing the risks arising from proposed alterative initialization from Xyz client.</p>
						<p><b>Action –</b> During execution of planned project activities for sorting the project quality issues, I made sure conform to the requirements and meeting satisfaction of customer. I prepared the project documents in which I mentioned the issues faced and how I along with the team sorted them related to quality. Furthermore, I learnt to analyze project issues in numerous projects. I evaluated the risks associated at the planning phase of the project which was particularly for creation of a risk reduction strategy and it allowed responding to the faced identified risks and issues. Further. I also learnt to develop techniques for maintaining and managing quality in the overall project processes execution.</p>
						<p><b>Response –</b> I executed the project process which included specifying size and following defined characteristics. However, it was difficult to control small factors which could cause the project to differ in slight manner from the set measurement. The factors included obtaining measurements which were higher than mandatory. There were various factors evaluated which had direct impact on the process and it was tend to offset each other with obtaining results. </p>
						
						<h4 class="kao">Develop strategies that encourage innovation and continuous improvement in project teams</h4>
						<p><b>Situation -</b> As a Project Manager at ABC Company, I encountered a situation that corresponded to this learning outcome.</p>
						<p><b>Task –</b> I was in charge of a war-on-waste project to reintegrate swapped out materials from a previous project to reduce congestion on the 3G network. As part of my role, I must form a team with resources from respective functional departments and lead them toward devising and implementing the best solution to achieve the project deliverable.</p>
						<p><b>Action - </b> I acted by surveying for 48 hours to introduce the project, identify resources from functional departments with high problem-solving skills who showed strong interest in taking up the challenge through their responses. I negotiated the resource release with the respective functional managers and then facilitated several brainstorming sessions that created process maps and Ishikawa diagrams on potential issues. During the brainstorming sessions, I accorded each team member 5 minutes to share their ideas or improve on already shared solutions while I put them up on the board.  Using the skills and tools I learned during six sigma training, I led the team, using failure mode and effects analysis to mitigate or eliminate the likelihood of a problem occurring. I made sure to keep an open-door policy and encouraged the team to share their ideas no matter how awkward it might be. During the pilot phase, I took a back seat and allowed the team to follow the already set plan and gave them the control to tweak the plan as required with the team’s buy-in. As part of the plan, a retrospective happened at the end of each phase and lessons learned were beneficial in the next phase of the project. This process ensured continuous improvement in the implementation. </p>
						<p><b>Response - </b> The project, tagged a success by the management as it saved the company a Capex of about $1m. However, the project’s most distinguished achievement is creating a turnkey deployment process of recycling swapped out materials using a self-organizing team with diverse functional resources.
