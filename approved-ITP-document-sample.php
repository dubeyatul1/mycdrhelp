I identified the requirements and applied in-depth computing along with the significant understanding obtained from various subjects studied [1].</p>
								<br/>
								<p>For example, in the bachelor degree level program, I was assigned a problem of computer slow operation which was needed to be solved using computing application knowledge. I worked on the Microsoft System Configuration which was the tool for tackling slow performance as there were many applications which automatically launched when the machine was booting up, which ultimately slowing down the performance of the system. For solving this issue, I opened the tool by pressing Window key + R and then typed msconfiq and pressed Enter key, which resulted in solving the issue by closing unnecessary applications.</p>

In my bachelor and master degree, I got significant learning of bit, bytes, megabytes and program writing and operation. I even learnt digital system images working and analysed big ideas which included logic, bugs and abstraction. One of my Professor also assisted in understanding the working of the structured data which included IP address, Ethernet, routing and Wi-Fi.</p>

                                <p>All the projects which I undertook were based on the team which was the essential part in making the project success. I worked with the team and often managed my juniors to accomplish the project objectives. Throughout my career, I worked on several projects and all were success because of the team work and the coordination that I had with my team to run and execute the project smoothly. For better project implementation, I synchronized with all the team members and it resulted in meeting the project requirements. Because of the role which I played both working as team member and leader, my projects different objectives were always meet successfully. Not only this, there were various scenarios which need to be handled carefully while working on sensitive projects. Like on one project, there was the need to login the portal urgently and I was the only person who got the password. I got to know that this might result in damaging the sensitive information. On the other side, everybody expects that I will tell them passwords or at least help to crack something so denying them tactfully, sometime straight forward denial, sometimes educating them about the ICT ethics was a part of my job.</p>  
                                <p>Also, I tried to educate about software copy rights and use of licensed software in the organization. In the country like India, we don’t have awareness of software licensing and very few people follow this unfortunately. I made my senior management aware of the consequences and worked up with some vendors and submitted the recommendations in front of them.</p>
