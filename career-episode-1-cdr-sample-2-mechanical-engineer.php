               <p align="justify">This career episode narrates to my project bearing title “Combined Pedal for Brake &amp; Accelerator’’. This project was carried out to fulfill the requirement of Mechanical Engineering Degree completion.</p>
               <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
               <p><strong>[CE 1.2]</strong></p>
               <h2>Nature of the Project</h2>
               <p align="justify">During braking, the foot pedal and support both moves in full downward direction such that, there would be no acceleration of the vehicle. This is achieved by fixing the acceleration cable at the bottom end of the pedal near the heel rest. The braking will be achieved by pressing the foot pedal fully down, to get the original position the spring is attached between pedal and the support. On releasing the pedal, the spring tends to come in original position due to spring action. Hence the driver can able to operate the vehicle using a single pedal.</p>
               <p><strong>[CE 1.3]</strong></p>
               <h2>Objective of the Project</h2>
               <p align="justify">During acceleration, the foot pedal rotates about the downward direction and lower half of pedal moves in upward direction i.e. rotation of foot pedal would be in anticlockwise direction. The support is kept below the foot pedal during acceleration, this opposite force is done by using helical spring. The main purpose of spring is to provide Resisting force to the support during throttling. Hence, by using upper half of the foot, driver can accelerate the vehicle without actuation of brakes.</p>
               <p><strong>[CE 1.4]</strong></p>
               <p align="justify">I completed this project in congregation with TWO other engineers. I was given the chance to lead the team.<br/><b> The project Hierarchy is given below.</b></p>

               <h2>Personal Engineering Activity</h2>
               <p><strong>[CE 1.5]</strong></p>
               <p align="justify">I did the project handling and management of this academic project since I was chosen team leader. I first consulted and discussed the entire project with my team mates and finalized to break down the project into multiple milestones and execute using this topology of management. I allocated multiple tasks to each member. After completion of each milestone I prepared a report and discussed the same with our project supervisor. I managed all the issues professionally and resolved in consent with the project supervisor.</p>
               <p><strong>[CE 1.6]</strong></p>
               <p align="justify">I went through all possible source to have an indepth understanding of the project working. I first gathered some information from the boks available in our university main library. I also chunked some piece of information from the internet.</p>
               <p><strong>[CE 1.7]</strong></p>
               <p align="justify"><b>My Roles &amp; Responsibilities -</b></p>
               <ul>
                 <li>Researching for the work done in the project scope</li>
                 <li>Project starting and executing strategy</li>
                 <li>Sorting out technical and design issues</li>
                 <li>Engineering design &amp; calculations</li>
                 <li>Detailed reporting of the project after completing each milestone</li>
                 <li>Drafting final project report</li>
               </ul>
               <p><strong>[CE 1.8]</strong></p>
               <h2>Working Principle</h2>
               <p align="justify">During acceleration, the foot pedal rotates about the downward direction and lower half of pedal moves in upward direction i.e. rotation of foot pedal would be in anticlockwise direction. I kept the support below the foot pedal during acceleration, this opposite force is done by using helical spring. The main purpose of spring is to provide Resisting force to the support during throttling. Hence, by using upper half of the foot, driver can accelerate the vehicle without actuation of brakes.</p>

               <p><strong>[CE 1.9]</strong></p>
               <h2>Engineering Design &amp; Components Used</h2>
               <p align="justify">As a team leader I drafted the list of components and the fabrication procedure for the combines pedal mechanism.</p>
               <p><b>Components Used -</b></p>
               <ul>
                 <li>C40 Steel (L-Section)</li>
                 <li>C40 Steel (Square Section)</li>
                 <li>Helical Spring</li>
                 <li>Engine</li>
                 <li>Bearing</li>
                 <li>Wheel</li>
                 <li>Accelerator Cable</li>
                 <li>Nuts &amp; Bolts</li>
                 <li>Chain &amp; Sprocket Set</li>
               </ul>
               <h2>Fabrication Methodology</h2>
               <p align="justify">I played key role in fabrication. The C40 steel square-section is cut into two or more pieces to the required size of the material. Then I assembled it to make the chase frame. The welding process was carried out. Before finishing welding the structure, I verified whether the structure is in right angle or not. I used L-angle to make support stand for fuel tank and engine. I connected the four wheels to the chase frame. The engine was mounted on the chase frame and bolted for the support. Then I connected the acceleration cable to the lower end of the foot pedal. The foot pedal is a 3mm metal plate which was supported on the column. After that I connected the brake line from two wheels are connected to the support column.</p>
               <p><strong>[CE 1.10]</strong></p>
               <p align="justify">I did the cost estimation after some thorough market research in congregation with the team mates. The details are as following</p>
               <h2>Direct Material Cost</h2>

               <h3>DIRECT LABOUR COST:</h3>
