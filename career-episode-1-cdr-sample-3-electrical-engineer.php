                <p><strong>[CE 1.5]</strong></p>
                <p>To achieve the ultimate goals of the project in an efficient way, I was assigned with significant responsibilities to be fulfilled. The major roles that I was given were the designing and supervising role in the project. <br/>
				
				<b>My duties and responsibilities included: </b></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>To perform communication to know the scope of the project</li>

                </ul>
                <h2 class="sample_heading">PERSONAL ENGINEERING ACTIVITY</h2>
                <p><strong>[CE 1.6]</strong></p>
                <p>As I was leading the electrical activities, I communicated with the project engineer for the feasibility of the electrical works to be done in this project. After understanding the scope of the project and the requirements of the client, it was requiring a fully new design of electrical system and later I summarized each need by listing on MS-Word. Then, I initiated the project work by designing the electrical drawing of the project. For this, I did various mathematical calculations and designed the working drawings, wiring diagrams, wiring connection specifications, etc. for the installation of the installation crew, which are described in the sections below. (ANZSCO 233311 Task 4, 9).</p>
                <p><strong>[CE 1.7]</strong></p>
                <p>According to the requirements of the client, I moved on to define the parts of the design of electrical plan. First, I performed to determine the general needs for the design of this electrical project like 220V holder outlets to be situated throughout the building for general purpose use. Moreover, I determined the specialized electrical equipment which would require separate electrical circuit made for them only. The equipment were computers, microwave ovens, cooler machines, etc. I did this as the load requirements of these equipment based on the manufacturer’s standards required separate circuitry and specialized methods of grounding. (ANZSCO 233311 Task 2, 4).</p>
                <p><strong>[CE 1.8]</strong></p>
                <p>Then, I performed to define the lighting design of the electrical system as a part of the design process, which required a huge amount of time for developing. In this system, I determined the design and calculations of the entire required lighting fixtures along with their controls. I incorporated all the required energy-saving technologies in the lighting system as per the standard needs. Moreover, I determined the electrical distribution system in the design which would provide the details of electrical wiring of the project. In this system, I included the main switchboard to receive the source of power from the serving utility, and the entire required components like as panelboards to distribute the overall branching circuits in the project, etc. In addition, I performed the calculations for finding out the amperage load and short-circuit values which determined the entire needs of the project. (ANZSCO 233311 Task 2, 4).</p>
                <p><strong>[CE 1.9]</strong></p>
                <p>After defining each part of the design plan, I progressed on to design the determined parts within the standards of National Electric Code (NEC). Also, I added the incorporated local code standards in the design plan. For the new parts of the distribution system, I considered the standards provided by the serving utility, which dictated the methods of wiring and electrical equipment necessary for the effective distribution. After then, I compiled all the determined parts to develop the design of electrical system and the entire set of electrical plans. For this, I used the tools of AutoCAD software to create the electrical plans digitally as it was easier to review and transmit the plans with this software. On the plan, I used the appropriate symbols of electrical systems so that anyone could understand the drawing.<br/><b> The workflow which I adopted while designing in AutoCAD was: (ANZSCO 233311 Task 1, 3, 4).</b></p>

                <p><strong>[CE 1.10]</strong></p>
                <p>After designing of the plans, I drew the master plans to show the relation of proposed installation design to the new facilities with exact specifications and dimensions. Also, I included the size of the cable which would be mandatory for carrying the required load of the electrical devices. I created a single line diagram which was explaining the capacity of the circuit breaker and electrical panel boards as per the loads of the entire electrical equipment. Moreover, I performed the mathematical calculations to find the conduit length required for this project following the compliances of NEC and project requirement. (ANZSCO 233311 Task 1, 3, 4).</p>
                <p><strong>[CE 1.11]</strong></p>
                <p>Further, I reviewed the plans technically and ensured that the plans were without any error and good to deliver. However, I consulted with the project engineer of the electrical department regarding the detailed review of the plans. Then, I got the approval of the electrical plans from the project engineer. After the approval, I finalized the design of electrical system for physical implementation. Moving on, I delivered a presentation on the electrical plans that I had designed to the installation crew in order to make them understand the plan. I ensured that the scopes of the project were fulfilled. (ANZSCO 233311 Task 1, 3, 4).</p>
                <p><strong>[CE 1.12]</strong></p>
                <p>After reviewing the completed electrical drawings and plans, I enlisted the required electrical equipment and forwarded to the procurement team requesting to make the materials available. Then, after receiving the materials, I reviewed their cost for accuracy and conformity to standards and regulations. Moreover, on the site, I consulted with the technicians and installation crews for verifying the materials required as per the drawing. In addition, I supervised the works of the electrical installation performed by the installation team. I guided them to understand the plan and install the equipment accordingly. Besides, at last, I tested the physical installation of the electrical equipment their connection and ensured that the works had been done effectively. (ANZSCO 233311 Task 4, 7).</p>
                <p><strong>[CE 1.13]</strong></p>
                <h2 class="sample_heading">Technical Problems and Resolutions</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>While supervising the installation work on the site, I had to perform the test of grounding system and while testing I found that the resistance value was smaller than required. Due to which, it might lead to damage the electrical equipment. In order to solve this problem and to avoid the damaging and protect the equipment, I suggested the installation team to install two extra conductors for the grounding. After the implementation of it, I found that the required value of resistance was gained. Thus, I ensured the proper safety of the electrical system. (ANZSCO 233311 Task 4, 7).</li>
                  <li>During the inspection of the ongoing works, I found that the lighting fixture had a light bulb which was of higher power than the fixture was premeditated for. This might cause damage to the socket and connected wires as the bulb’s high heat could melt the socket and insulation on the fixture's wires leading to the risk of catching fire. So, I suggested the installation team to install the bulb by staying within the wattage limit marked on the lighting fixtures. Then, the problem was resolved and was not repeated again. (ANZSCO 233311 Task 3, 7).</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>[CE 1.14]</strong></p>
                <h2 class="sample_heading">Creative Work</h2>
                <p>After designing the electrical system plans, it was necessary to show that the designed electrical plans were based on the client requirements and the latest technologies. So, I prepared a master plan to show the relation of proposed installations design to the new facilities with exact specifications and dimensions. I performed the mathematical calculations adopting the standard parameters required like voltage, current, resistance, etc. to find out the size of the cable. So, I included the size of the cable which would be mandatory for carrying the required load of the electrical devices. I created a single line diagram which was explaining the capacity of the circuit breaker and electrical panel boards as per the loads of each electrical equipment. (ANZSCO 233311 Task 1, 2, 3).</p>
                <p><strong>[CE 1.15]</strong></p>
                <p>During the entire project tenure, I coordinated with all the stakeholders of this project like workers, technicians, installation crew, etc. in an efficient way under the Project Manager’s management. I conferred the project contentions with them in a regular manner. Also, I shared my ideas and opinions with them and always looked forward to appreciate their precious views to be used in the project implementation. I prepared the progress reports of the project and submitted them to the project manager on a weekly basis. In addition to these, I used to organize meetings with the workers to know about the issues if facing. Moreover, I delivered a presentation on the electrical plans to the installation crew.</p>
                <p><strong>[CE 1.16]</strong></p>
                <p>I maintained the ethics of an Electrical Engineer in implementing the project activities of this project. I executed the activity plan under professional demeanor of engineering. I always followed the custom of the Company and maintained the requirements of the client during the execution of the project. I coordinated with the project engineer and the installation crew in a very efficient way. I followed the standards of ICS 29.060: Electrical wires and cables while requesting the required electrical materials to the procurement team. Throughout the project, I followed the custom of National Electrical Code (NEC).</p>
                <h2 class="sample_heading">Summary</h2>
                <p><strong>[CE 1.17]</strong></p>
                <p>It was my fortune to implement the visionary skills and engineering knowledge to complete this project. I completed my works of this project efficiently. For the completion and the achievement of the goal and all the objectives of this project, I applied my understanding of electrical installation design and practical skills of electrical engineering. After the accomplishment, I reviewed the completed work to ensure the effective construction of the electrical system. To specify the standard for quality as per specifications, I had consultations with the Project Manager. From this project, I perfectly enhanced my design and installing skills of electrical system. Finally, this project made me expert in the field of designing electrical system and working in a team.</p>
