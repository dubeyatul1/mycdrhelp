                    <p>This career episode relates to project titled <strong>“Mile End Development’’. </strong>The project was assigned to me as a part of my Civil Engineering Draftsperson course at TAFESA.</p>
                    <p>TAFESA was established in the year 1935 offering more than 80 areas of industry and activity from last 47 years. TAFESA takes more than 70,000 students each year and it has more than 300 locations over South Australia. It is the largest vocational education and training (VET) and one of the largest in Australia. TAFESA also registered for higher education provider.</p>
                    <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
                    <p><b>[CE 1.2]</b></p>
                    <p>A residential project in Adelaide involved land division, a new dwelling and modifications to the existing allotment. Referring to the Proposed Development Plan, the new allotment, will have a dwelling built on land that was previously the garden and rear yard of the existing allotment. The Proposed Dwelling including Garage and the Store in the existing allotment required the design of new footings. The Proposed Carport in the existing allotment required the design of structural framing and pad footings. Due consideration was to be given to the disposal of the additional stormwater runoff resulting from the development.</p>

                    <p>The management of time in this project was a critical aspect and a luxury we can’t afford. I worked in synchronization with the team mates and our project supervisor through out the project. I also allocated roles &amp; responsibilities to other team members. I resolved all the snags and glitches amid the team members during project completion. I reported the project proceeding to the supervisor on weekly basis and also compiled the final report for prior submission.</p>
                    <p><b>CE [1.7]</b></p>
                    <p>I designed the carport using SHS columns, cold-formed purlins, roof sheeting and threaded rod bracing. I classified site and made drawings. I performed site classification by determining active soil movement (soil heave). I also determined the wind speed and wind actions for the proposed dwelling.</p>
                    <p>I used AutoCAD, Revit Architectural and Revit Structural for the designing of the house.</p>
                    <p>During pipe line design for storm water drainage I was really stuck at numerous points. I worked with my supervisor and also researched over the internet resources to resolve the issue. I rechecked the established pipe network within the design software and found that I was not using the right application criterion. I selected the right tools and finished a proper and authentic design.</p>

                    <p>I introduced Gantt chart to track our work in a team which helped us a lot because it was developed clearly and what has all the details about every week job.</p>
                    <p>I divided the jobs amid the team and this helped us in balancing the work load and finishing the project well within stipulated timeframe. The lecturers and supervisor guided us in numerous occasions. I also took help from internet resources to carry out respective project work.</p>
                    <p>Since there were many areas where works were going on simultaneously every day I was interacting with my team mates to discuss regarding the targets to be achieved, safety procedures to be followed, scope of the work, regarding the allocation of the resources. Once in a week, we had a meeting with project supervisor who supervised us right way. We used to discuss about upcoming weeks work, resource allocation and what are the things were behind from us.</p>
