                <p>This career episode relates to project titled “MADA Cooling Warehouses’’. This project was carried out during my tenure at AL ALSHAL Contracting &amp; Engineering Works as Project Manager.</p>
                <h2 class="sample_heading">BACKGROUND</h2>
                <p><strong>[CE 1.2]</strong></p>
                <p>In the past few years the client old warehouses have perceived lots of glitches with slabs, roofs and insulation. In addition, the client was appreciative to rent more than 5 warehouses in order to afford his expansion in the market which in turn brought about a mammoth cost.</p>
                <p><strong>[CE 1.3]</strong></p>
                <p>As a result, there was a decision of building new warehouse with a very high quality in all Engineering aspects. Avoiding the problems with the slabs and providing high quality materials for the walls and the roof to ensure there will be no insulation issues and applying a strict construction measures to ensure the build quality. Along with all these aspects covered it was also in the scope to install advanced cooling systems for the warehouses.</p>
                <p><strong>[CE 1.4]</strong></p>
                <p>The project Hierarchy is given below.</p>

                <p><strong>[CE 1.5]</strong></p>
                <p>I was entirely responsible for the management of the project at each phase. In order to make this project easily executable and for being completed in stipulated time; I divided the project into multiple phases. In the first phase I studied all the basic scenarios of the project and drafted the phase completion sheet for proper project execution. In the final stage I employed professional strategies for effective completion of the project.</p>

                <h2 class="sample_heading">PROBLEM FACED &amp; THEIR RECTIFICATIONS</h2>
                <p><b>Problem A</b></p>
                <p>When we started executing the initial work there was a level difference in land between the Eastern and Western edges of the building of 2.52 m surrounded by a full constructed road and city utilities and the design was for a Zero slope land.</p>
                <p><b>Effect of problem: </b>If I had continued with the basic design the building would have not been horizontal because of the slope.</p>
                <p><b>Root Cause of Problem: </b>The chief problem that the designer did not consider was the condition of the land which was proposed to construct on.</p>
                <p><b>Final Solution: </b>I made a change to the design and changed the cut and fell levels in order to be able to install the building on a flat earth.</p>
                <p><b>Problem B: </b></p>
                <p>After studying the original design for the building, I comprehended that there are some items which were over-estimated in the aspect of volumes and sizes. Dimensions of Concrete foundations, Concrete columns, and some grade beams were bigger than they should be according to my revision to the designs. Besides all this some of the steel bars diameter were not available in the local market.</p>
                <p><b>Effect of problem: </b>This glitch was likely to cost the client about 30% higher than it should be and workers would take much more time working on them, especially on the momentous diameters of the steel bars. which might prolong my project time as well.</p>
                <p><b>Root Cause of Problem: </b>The deliberation of safety was way over rated than it should be.</p>
                <p><b>Final Solution: </b>I did new calculations and abridged the dimensions of the items beside changing the type of foundations from striped (continuous) to separated, and got them approved from management and In conclusion after completing the projects the calculations connected to cost were totally factual.</p>
                <p><strong>[CE 1.8]</strong></p>
                <p>I made the design of the concrete slab of the roof for the management building. It was supposed to be steel structure roof but a change came to make it reinforced concrete. I studied the properties of the steel columns and girders and took into deliberation their maximum bearing loads since the slab will be placed upon steel columns and beams. I did the Beam Design calculations as following Nominal cover, cnom cnom = cmin + Δcdev where cmin = max[cmin,b; cmin,dur] where cmin,b = minimum cover due to bond = diameter of bar Assume 25 mm main bars cmin,dur = minimum cover due to environmental conditions Assuming XC3 and using C40 concrete, cmin,dur = 20 mm Δcdev = allowance in design for deviation assuming no measurement of cover Δcdev is an allowance which should be made in the design for deviations from the minimum cover. It should be taken as 10 mm, unless fabrication (i.e. construction) is subjected to a quality assurance system, in which case it is permitted to reduce Δcdev to 5 mm. Δcdev = 10 mm cnom = 20 + 10 = 30 mm Fire Check adequacy of section for 2 hour fire resistance (REI 120) Thickness, b = 300 mm amin = 55 mm a=40+1/2∅=30+1/2 32+10=56 mm ∴ OK a=56 mm</p>
                <h2 class="sample_heading">Depth of the beam:</h2>
                <p>d=h-a=550-56=494 mm Interior slab span is 5.25 m. Permanent (Gk) Self-weight of the slab - 0.2 × 25 x 5.25 Finishes – 0.5 x 5.25 Self-weight of the beam Total permanent load (Gk) Variable (Qk) – 4.0 x 5.25 26.25 kN / m 2.625 kN / m 2.5 kN / m 31.375 kN / m 21.0 kN / m Partial factors for actions: Partial factor for permanent actions γ_G=1.35 Partial factor for variable actions γ_Q=1.50 Combination of actions at ULS: Design load,w=γ_G g_k+γ_Q q_k=1.35*31.375+1.5*21.0=73.9 kN/m</p>
                <p>I used the ULTIMATE design method in designing a flat slab with a total area of 150 m2 then re-assured my results by using the WORKING method in SAP2000 design application after making a detailed drawing using AutoCAD and I used the results from SAP2000 at the end.</p>
                <p>I designed the staircases as following</p>
                <p><strong>[CE 1.9]</strong></p>
                <p>During my work as a civil Engineer I was committed to check some items during construction. For instance, I did some analysis for many parts of reinforced concrete in the project according to design data and specifications. Sections varied from small to large sections of columns, beams and slabs.</p>
                <p>I was mainly focusing in calculating Ultimate Moment MU and PU.</p>
                <p>Process and formulas: - Determine if the section is large or small one e/t=…………….. - Calculating internal forces: Cc= .67(Yc/Fcu)*a*b=………….(a) - T= As*(Fy/Ys) =………….. KN - Cs= As’ * (Fy/Ys)=……….. - PU = Cc+Cs-T=………..(a) - MU=Cc(t/2-a/2)+Cs(t/2-d’)+T(t/2-d’)=……………(a)</p>
                <p><strong>[CE 1.10]</strong></p>
                <p>As a lead Civil-Engineer starting with no outside help I arranged records and reports for unfurling the entire procedure. I was similarly responsible to display reports and advance points of interest to the officials. I oversaw all the venture related errands since venture management is additionally a key piece of architect's fundamental parts and obligations.</p>
                <p><strong>[CE 1.11]</strong></p>
                <p>The project frolicked significant role in my professional career. The project also raised my project preparation, development, leading &amp; administration skills. I also acquired know how of using external capitals when the team was not able to outbreak the complex issues. I also cultured a lot about team supervision ability. Overall this project played a part of edifice block in my professional practice.</p>
