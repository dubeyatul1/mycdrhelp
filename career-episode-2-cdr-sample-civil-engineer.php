                <p>This career episode relates to project titled “Ministry of Interior Branch Building’’. This project was carried out during my tenure at AL ALSHAL Contracting &amp; Engineering Works as Project Manager.</p>
                <h2 class="sample_heading">BACKGROUND</h2>
                <p><strong>[CE 2.2]</strong></p>
                <p>The ministry of interior branches over the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has witnessed an increase in the number of employee with no enough places in the buildings available for them. Qassim branch was one of these branches faced that problem. Consequently, there was a need for building new facilities or adding offices for the existing buildings.</p>
                <p><strong>[CE 2.3]</strong></p>
                <p>There was an old building, it was used as a prison in the past and it was exactly beside the branch building of the ministry. The goal was to construct a 3-story building on 2800 m2 area of land and connect it with a resistance building of 5000 m2 and repair the old one and redesign it internally in order to transfer it from prison to offices for new employees and off course connecting these two parts with the main branch building architecturally and on other aspects i.e. power &amp; data etc.</p>
                <p><strong>[CE 2.4]</strong></p>
                <p><b>The project Hierarchy is given below -</b></p>
                <h2 class="sample_heading">PERSONAL ENGINEERING ACTIVITY</h2>
                <p><strong>[CE 2.5]</strong></p>
                <p>I was entirely responsible for the management of the project at each phase. In order to make this project easily executable and for being completed in stipulated time; I divided the project into multiple phases. In the first phase I studied all the basic scenarios of the project and drafted the phase completion sheet for proper project execution. In the final stage I employed professional strategies for effective completion of the project.</p>
                <p><strong>[CE 2.6]</strong></p>
                <p><b>My Roles &amp; Responsibilities -</b></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Studying all project documents and preparing the final proposal for the Ministry of Interior in order to win the project.</li>
                  <li>Make price analysis and choose subcontractors for some items of the project.</li>
                  <li>Reading original drawings and check the designed items and make changes when needed.</li>
                  <li>Making structural designs for the new building (Concrete foundations, Columns and slab).</li>
                  <li>Applying the drawings and designs to reality</li>
                  <li>Directing and leading the team and subcontractors.</li>

                <h2 class="sample_heading">PROBLEM FACED &amp; THEIR RECTIFUCATIONS</h2>
                <h2 class="sample_heading">Problem A</h2>
                <p><b>Problem Definition: </b>The new building and the old prison should be connected to the main branch building as one piece by an external pass where they all have access. The problem was that by depending on that path as a connector we had to deal with an existing reinforced concrete wall on the edge between the branch building and the prison going through the pass and there was no agreement for removing the same.</p>
                <p><b>Effect of problem: </b>Apart from the delay in the project waiting for the ministry to agree eliminating the wall, using this pass as a connector we would have to install our pipe lines for electricity, data, and mechanical work through the wall all along the path which could have cost us over 50% more than the anticipated calculations.</p>
                <p><b>Root Cause of Problem: </b>Reinforced concrete wall found on the path and no acceptance to remove it or even any part of it.</p>
                <p><b>Final Solution: </b>Instead of using the proposed pass to connect the buildings, I suggested to connect them directly from the middle by some internal walkthroughs. This will make us avoid removing the wall in addition to a remarkable save in cost for the electromechanical work.</p>
                <h2 class="sample_heading">Problem B:</h2>
                <p>Applying the solution stated above created us another problem summarized in decreasing area due to the internal pass and redesigning the offices.</p>
                <p><b>Effect of problem: </b>A notable proportion of the area was lost in the new pass (exactly 180 m2). Because of this, the offices should either be decreased in area or in number.</p>
                <p><b>Root Cause of Problem: </b>Adding internal pass bonding buildings in the middle instead of the old outside one.</p>
                <p><b>Final Solution: </b>I insisted in Continuing with the new pass in the middle and combine the outer pass to the buildings area by installing steel columns on reinforced concrete foundations and connect the columns with buildings by fixed main girders connects steel columns with the reinforced concrete columns of the building.</p>
                <p><strong>[CE 2.8]</strong></p>
                <p>I designed reinforced concrete elements of the new building. Reinforced concrete foundations, columns, Grade beams, Slabs. The objective was to obtain safe design with the least cost as possible and I was able to fulfill that. I used the original drawings from the Ministry and made some changes using AutoCAD to add the new path and other changes related to actual dimensions in the site. After that I loaded the drawing to SAP2000 and defined items, sections, materials then applied loads and ran the program then obtaining analysis results which I used in design the items sections using a prepared excel chat for designing theses concrete elements using the WORKING loads for design.</p>
                <h2 class="sample_heading">COLUMN DESIGN</h2>
         
                <p>Using fck = 40 N/mm2 and fy = 500 N/mm2, one hour fire resistance and mild condition of exposure, design the columns on gridline 2 and 3, on the ground floor. Cover Nominal cover, cnom cnom = cmin + Δcdev Assume 32 mm main bars cmin,dur = minimum cover due to environmental conditions Assuming X1 and using C40 concrete, cmin,dur = 15 mm Δcdev = allowance in design for deviation assuming no measurement of cover Δcdev is an allowance which should be made in the design for deviations from the minimum cover. It should be taken as 10 mm, unless fabrication (i.e. construction) is subjected to a quality assurance system, in which case it is permitted to reduce Δcdev to 5 mm. Δcdev = 10 mm cnom = 15 + 10 = 25 mm Fire For R 120: b_min=175 mm a_min=35 mm a=25+∅_link+1/2 ∅_bar=25+10+1/2 32=51 mm Try a = 51mm Effective depth d=b-a=300-51=239 mm Loading Roof loading Permanent Self-weight 0.200 × 25 Variable (Qk) 5.0 kN/m2 1.5 kN/m2 Floor loading Permanent Self-weight 0.2 × 25 Variable (Qk) 5.0 kN/m2 4.0 kN/m2 Load combination, Ultimate load, 1.35 Gk + 1.5 Qk Roof load: w=1.35*5.0+1.5*1.5≈9.0 kN/m^2 Floor load: w=1.35*5.0+1.5*4.0≈12.75 kN/m^2 Beam weight: 1.35*25*0.3*(0.55)=5.57/m Loading on column N_2B=w_Roof*A_roof+w_floor*A_floor+w_(beam )+w_column=9.0*(7.5*5.25)+12.75*(7.5*5.25)+5.57*(7.5+5.25)+0.3*0.3*25*2*(3.5-0.85)=940 kN</p>
                <p><strong>[CE 2.9]</strong></p>
                <p>Despite using applications for analysis and design I have a habit to check some items manually to make sure that everything is correct. I was using Ultimate loads method to check some reinforced concrete sections manually. I designed some elements and compared the results to the applications and fortunately there was no big difference in most cases. For instance. I checked most of the columns by manual design for braced columns. He=K*Ho where K= 1 for braced column He=……….. X-X direction Ybx= He/b S=(Ybx)2 *(b)/2000 =………. M= Pu*S AND SO ON FOR Y-Y direction So, we have the additional moment M and Pu (KN) Using NID table and design formula for column we obtain As and choose reinforcement.</p>
                <p><strong>[CE 2.10]</strong></p>
                <p>As a lead Civil-Engineer starting with no outside help I arranged records and reports for unfurling the entire procedure. I was similarly responsible to display reports and advance points of interest to the officials. I oversaw all the venture related errands since venture management is additionally a key piece of architect's fundamental parts and obligations.</p>
                <p><strong>[CE 2.11]</strong></p>
                <h2 class="sample_heading">SUMMARY</h2>
                <p>The project frolicked significant role in my professional career. The project also raised my project preparation, development, leading &amp; administration skills. I also acquired know how of using external capitals when the team was not able to outbreak the complex issues. I also cultured a lot about team supervision ability. Overall this project played a part of edifice block in my professional practice.</p>
