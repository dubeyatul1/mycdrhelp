                      <h2>CE 3.1</h2>
                      <p>This career episode relates to project titled <strong>“Gawler East Link Road’’. </strong>The project was done as a Civil Drafter at Tonkin Consulting Engineering Adelaide South Australia.</p>
                      <p>Tonkin Consulting engineering was established in the year 1955 having about 63 years of experience in engineering industry. Tonkin Consulting Engineering started its operation from Woodville West in South Australia in only double garage and now expanded one of the leading engineering consultant in South Australia as well as in entire Australia. The company has diversified and spread into various divisions such as asset management, automotive engineering, building structures, construction administration, contaminated land, environmental consulting, Geographical information systems, infrastructure planning, land development, mine infrastructure, pavement design and management, storm water management, transport planning, landfill engineering, water resource management.</p>
                      <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
                      <h2>CE 3.2</h2>
                      <p>The state government of South Australia announced $55 million for this project in 2015-2016 budgeting plan. The major construction of this project is expected to complete by end of the year 2019 and the post construction such as operation and maintenance will start after the year 2019. This project is the 30-year plan for greater Adelaide and to develop the town Gawler. It provides opportunity to traffic user direct access to Main North Road without passing through Gawler town center and reduces the travel time as well as fuel emission. This project is expected to provide economic benefits and will support jobs for local people over the life cycle of the project.</p>
                      <p><b>Objective</b></p>
                      <p>The objective is simply completing the project through designing and construction stage. But my role was drawing drainage and making cross section of the abutment of the bridge. The bridge need to make on the way to this road. I was also responsible to check the final bridge CAD design drawings and validate their effectiveness. It was necessary to include all trades in these CAD drawings.</p>

                      <h2>PERSONAL ENGINEERING ACTIVITY</h2>
                      <h2>CE 3.3</h2>
                      <p><strong>My Roles &amp; Responsibilities</strong></p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Project work planning</li>
                        <li>Organizing work &amp; keeping track of the project proceedings</li>
                        <li>Editing drawing files as per directions</li>
                        <li>Bridge drawing working</li>
                        <li>AutoCAD drawing layout planning</li>
                        <li>Presentations &amp; Documentations</li>
                      </ul>
                      <h2>CE 3.4</h2>
                      <p>The main problem I encountered as CAD drawings editor and drafter was working on the bridge Cad design diagram. The CAD design of bridge wasn’t done keeping all the trades in line. I took charge and edited the bridge design from start and presented a reliable, yet most latest deign taking in to account all relative trades.</p>

                      <h2>CE 3.5</h2>
                      <p>I used AutoCAD and Auto TURN software in this project. As I was junior trainee level, I was asking some drawing related questions to my leader. My leader used to make meetings every two weeks, talking how the work is going on to track the work process.</p>
                      <p>I did some drawing of making contour line, making drainage using AutoCAD software and drawn road using AUTOTURN for vehicle specification.</p>
                      <p>Gantt chart was used to track the work to accomplish on time which showed the percentage of work done, percentage of work left. How time left to finish task before hitting the target date.</p>
                      <p>I also gave a short presentation of what I have done for this project.</p>
                      <h2>CE 3.6</h2>
                      <h2>Summary</h2>
                      <p>The project was successfully concluded. I was able to complete our project on time as well as my colleague too. I completed my project with high precision so that I got good result on it.</p>
                      <p>As it was one-month contract job, I completed what my leader asked me to do. I reckon, it had still more to do it but not from my side, it was from senior engineer side.</p>
                      <p>I used my AutoCAD knowledge which is pretty much pre-engineering knowledge. But from this experienced I got an opportunity to learn Auto TURN software as well. The basic knowledge of AutoCAD I learned at TAFE which helped me a lot while I was doing this work experience.</p>
                      <p>I learned from this project more AutoCAD command which we use in the industry. Gave me some knowledge about how drafting work is done at industry which was very usable. And also learned how to use Auto TURN which was I had never ever used.</p>
                      <p><strong>Learning from the project were</strong></p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Understanding of project scope</li>
                        <li>I learned from this project more AutoCAD command which we use in the industry.</li>
