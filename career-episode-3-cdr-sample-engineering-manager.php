                  <h2 class="sample_heading">INTRODUCTION</h2>
                  <p><strong>[CE 3.1]</strong></p>
                  <p>I worked on this project as Engineering Manager in National Industrialization Company (TASNEE).</p>
                  <p>Project Name: HCIS- Integrated Security Systems</p>
                  <p>Duration: 30th Nov 2014 - 5th May 2018</p>
                  <p>Project Location: Jubail Industrial City, Jubail, Saudi Arabia</p>
                  <p>Name of the Organization: National Industrialization Company (TASNEE)</p>
                  <p>Position: Engineering Manager</p>
                  <p>Supervisor: Head of Department, Project Execution Organization</p>
                  <h2 class="sample_heading">BACKGROUND</h2>
                  <p><strong>[CE 3.2]</strong></p>
                  <p>Tasnee was established in 1985 as the first Saudi private sector's fully owned joint stock industrial company with the aim of advancing the economic diversification in Saudi Arabia. TASNEE’s Petrochemical complex in Jubail Industrial City Saudi Arabia's second largest Petrochemical producer, after SABIC. Due to the importance of petroleum, industrial and services facilities, the Saudi Arabia’s leadership urged the establishment of a High Commission for Industrial Security and set the policies and plans to protect such facilities overseeing the areas of security, safety and fire protection, to ensure on-going process of work and production under all circumstances. Thus, a royal decree number 8/439, dated 27/2/1397 H., was issued approving the formation of the High Commission for Industrial Security with H.R.H. Crown Prince, Deputy Premier and Interior Minister as its Chairmen, and membership of a number of heir royal highnesses and their excellences.</p>
                  <p><strong>[CE 3.3]</strong></p>
                  <p>The High Commission for Industrial Security (HCIS) had made it mandatory for all Petrochemical Companies to upgrade their Security Systems for compliance to the HCIS Directives. Hence, the project charter was compliance to HCIS 2010 Directives and implement all necessary changes to the TASNEE Security Infrastructure.</p>
                  <p><strong>[CE 3.4]</strong></p>
                  <p><b>My duties and responsibilities in the project were: </b></p>

                  <p><strong>[CE 3.6]</strong></p>
                  <p>After reviewing the HCIS 2010 Directives, I had prepared a Project Scope and assigned resources. I had put together my team with the following discipline engineers and assigned them the followings tasks:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Manager QA/QC to ensure compliance to specification and carrying out necessary inspection test plants</li>
                    <li>Manager SHE to ensure compliance to all aspects of safety, both for internal client (i.e. maintaining TASNEE internal safety standards) and for external client (i.e. compliance with HCIS directives)</li>
                    <li>Electronics Engineer to review the equipment specifications like X-Ray machines, Cameras, Turnstiles and barrier systems</li>
                    <li>Electrical Engineer to conduct Load studies and ensure adequate power is made available, including cable selection and junction boxes</li>
                    <li>Mechanical Engineer to review all mechanical related items including mechanical works for the Search Facility Building.</li>
                    <li>IT Engineer to review all communication between access points and cameras to the main integrated server system.</li>
                    <li>Civil Engineer to review all static bollards, fencing and excavation works.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><strong>[CE 3.7]</strong></p>
                  <p>The project started off with the FEED phase and I worked with the HCIS Consulting firm to review the 30% and 60% Models. After completion of FEED, I used the MTO (Material Take Off) and assigned each of the discipline engineer assisted in coming costing data. I prepared Cost Estimate to be presented to the management for budget. <b>Below is the precis of my cost estimate results:</b></p>

                  <p><strong>[CE 3.8]</strong></p>
                  <p>The above costing data was then used to compare actuals vs planned as a tool to manage costs. I used the following stepwise Risk Assessment methodology for the project to develop a risk matrix.</p>
                  <p>Step 1: Identification of major accident event.</p>
                  <p>Step 2: Modelling of potential consequences.</p>
                  <p>Step 3: Calculation of frequency of hazardous event outcomes.</p>
                  <p>Step 4: Calculation of risk levels.</p>
                  <p>Step 5: Comparison of risk study results with acceptable risk guidelines.</p>

                  <p><strong>[CE 3.9]</strong></p>
                  <p>I identified risks, maintained a risk register and updated risk which helped the project a lot to keep on track and avoid cost overruns and schedule slippages. I did a market survey and prequalified contractors to execute this project. Based on the FEED, I prepared the SOW and RRP package for the construction companies specializing in implementing safety projects. I reviewed the bids received form a technical standpoint and later once the commercial bids were opened, I was assigned to go back to the BOM (Bill of Material) and do value engineering to see where quantities can be optimized. These iterations in value engineering resulting in much lower final bid price.</p>
                  <p><strong>[CE 3.10]</strong></p>
                  <p>As part of the project progress reporting, I had directed my team to give me periodic input regarding the project progress. I had to conduct high level monthly internal and external customer project progress meeting Internal clients included staff from Operations and external clients included personnel from Industrial Security. One of the mandate from Industrial Security was that during the execution of the project, the perimeter security shall not be compromised at any given time.</p>

                  <p><strong>[CE 3.11]</strong></p>
                  <p>I had to monitor the project progress and keep vigilant about the variations between Actual versus Planned, so mitigation steps can be taken. The project performance was being continuously monitors with inputs coming from various lead engineers. Below is the except from a presentation I made in an internal progress review meeting:</p>

                  <p>I was involved in managing my team staffs and I had the safety officer to put up safety signs. I had arranged the regular awareness program among all the team staff about the security system. Then I was involved in conducting the morning toolbox and a weekly management safety walk through. After that, I conducted the regular meeting for assigning the safety signs in each block of the buildings. Additionally, I researched various safety tools and arranged them in the procurement order for assigning each safety sign. While selecting the safety tools, the power consuming and cost effective safety tools were given priority. Furthermore, I arranged a meeting with the project coordinator for the arrangement of the best safety tools that suit the designed security system. Finally, I arranged the training of the project coordinators with the high-class family of the safety signs managing team.</p>
                  <p><strong>[CE 3.13]</strong></p>
                  <p><b>The following were the main difficulties that I faced during the project time -</b></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>HCIS (high commission for industrial security) noted that critical assets such as storage and refrigerant tank, substation were located within the 60 meters from the facility perimeter fence. However, the location of these assets did not comply with SEC-02 section 4.9 which required a 60-meter clear zone from the critical assets to the perimeter fence. Further COD proposed a “video fence” on the dike wall but that did not mitigate the potential risks associated with the limited distance of the assets from the perimeter fence. So for this, I added the additional measures of using dedicated fixed CCTV cameras with video analytics that were included in 30% design to extend the 60-meter clear zone requirements beyond the facility perimeter. Hence the addition of CCTV helped in locating the assets within the required distance.</li>
                    <li>HCIS noted on drawing KDOCS-062PF-COD-0001 that the security control center and support facilities indicated near the main gate was inside the perimeter clear zone and the walls formed part of the perimeter fence. The location of the building violated SEC-02 section 4.5 and 4.9. HCIS SEC directives did not provide for building walls to replace the perimeter fence as stipulated in SEC-02 section 4.5. In order to solve this problem, I advised that the security control center was to be relocated near to truck unloading area.</li>
                    <li>One of the directives of HCIS was to conduct and then develop a worst-case scenarios report of blast consequences in case of vapor cloud explosion due to the presence of hydrocarbons within the petrochemical plant. Two scenarios were developed to facilitate the blast consequence analysis. One was “worst case” scenario for a release due to hydrocarbon tank/drum leakage and other was “Most Likely” scenario for a release due to pipe rupture. The VCE could cause the complete destruction of certain parts of the building and serious injuries to humans in certain areas. Overpressure impacts of 1psi or greater caused by VCEs in the worst case scenarios could extend to more than 840m from the centre of VCEs and most likely scenarios could extend to more than 440m from the center of VCEs. I proposed the breeze modelling software for doing explosion damage assessment modelling and incident analysis. The software implied the theory of distance/damage correlations, pressure/impulse/damage correlation, blast effect curves, and blast resistance of the building and human injury resistance of blasts to each designed scenario. The images below show the scenarios.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p><b>Based on the blast consequence analysis conducted, I concluded that:</b></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>SAMSUNG Old Offices should be relocated or reinforced.</li>
                    <li>Future operator shelters should all be reinforced without the use of vulnerable materials.</li>
                    <li>Future portable buildings should be sited in the 0.6 psi to 0.9 psi zone only. It is much safer to have portable building be in the less than 0.6 psi zone.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h2 class="sample_heading">Summary</h2>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>[CE 3.14]</strong> The overall project implementation was successful and had a great learning experience for myself and I shared my lessons learned with my team. The project completed successfully with minor cost impact and schedule delay due to change in HCIS directives from 2010 to 2017, complying to which mean cost and schedule impact. These impacts were managed successfully by myself and my team and were within the project budget. I received certificate of appreciation from the Projects Procurement Manager for my help in selection of main contractor and throughout the bidding process, from technical evaluation of bids to doing value engineering and reducing project costs.</p>
