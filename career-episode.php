One's engineering experiences play a vital role in crafting an effective CDR.In the CDR report, it will not suffice to mention that you successfully handled all the problems that occurred during the project. You have to elaborate on what types of problems and challenges you faced and how you overcame them. For example.</p>
                              <p><span class="when">“When we tested the prototype, we found that its tolerance was less than what was required in our design specification. I analyzed the circuit design but could not figure out the error right away. Hence, I devised a series of tests to separately test all the different input parameters and the operating environment step-by-step and found that the vibration was affecting the input transducer.I replaced the transducer with a better one and had to redesign the control circuitry to accommodate the new component. Then, we re-conducted all the tests and were finally able to meet the design specifications successfully.”</span></p>

You should check out the guidelines of EA and try to understand what they look for in the candidates of different occupation category (Professional Engineer, Engineering Technologist, Engineering Associate, or Engineering Manager) and be able to choose career episodes which will best depict your qualities.</li>
                                <li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> The report should be focussed on you and your achievements rather than the details of the company. Information of the company should be brief, and the history and market share information is not required. Rather you must focus on your objectives and the role assigned to you and how you were able to achieve them. You can provide details of what have been your personal contributions to the company and awards and achievements that you might have received.</li>
                                <li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>The career episodes should be broken into paragraphs, and each paragraph should be carefully linked to the summary statement. This provides for easy reference and points out your competencies clearly. The writers who provide CDR help claim that the Summary statement is the first page which is read by the assessing authorities as it provides them the brief of your capabilities, knowledge, and skill. It also tells them about your analytical skills and your eye for detail.</li>
                                <li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>The career episode should always be written in first person and an active voice.
