				  <p>Currently, there is a big demand for engineers in Australia. If you are an overseas engineer and wish to avail of this opportunity, but not having the accreditation from Engineers Australia then no need to worry. The CDR writing service for Engineers Australia Skill Assessment is here to help you create an impressive CDR.</p>
				  <p>A CDR showcases an applicant's technical skills. Hence, it is important that you choose the right topics for your Career Episodes. The first step towards getting Engineers Australia Membership is to identify the occupational category the applicant can apply in and then choose those projects from their career which will meet the Engineers Australia competency criteria.</p>
				  <h3>The guidelines to produce a perfect CDR</h3>
				  <p>Many engineers with the aim of a new life apply for Skilled Migration Visa to Australia. However, they lack the competency to write their own CDR reports due to a deficiency in English and also for fear of getting rejected.  </p>
				  <p>If you are into such a situation, you should not worry as here are given the eleven commandments to prepare your CDR report in the best way possible which will ensure approval by EA Australia.</p>
				  <p>You should first make a list of the projects that you would want to describe in your CDR report, and once it is done, you should have the following details with you. </p>
					<ul class="wewre">
					<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>Name and location of the company 
					<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>Objectives of the project
					<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>Company History
					<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>Your career stage (project as part of internship of career break)
					<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>Duration of the project
					<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>Your position and responsibilities
					</ul>
					<p>You should showcase your responsibilities and tasks according to the guidelines of the ANZSCO Code of your engineering discipline while writing the Career Episodes. Each career episode must include a group of 5-6 tasks from the tasks mentioned above and each paragraph should be connected to the summary statement. You should ensure to only use first person and active voice while writing the CDR. </p>
					<p>You should showcase your responsibilities and the challenges you took while in the project and how you applied the engineering skills to solve issues at the work front. The panel at the Engineers Australia are interested to find out your skills, knowledge, and capabilities which is the main purpose of submitting a CDR. So, it would help if you chose the projects which you want to describe in your CDR properly, and it should meet the engineering discipline which you have mastered so that the EA assessment authorities can relate your job profile. </p>
					<p>Wherever possible, you must include designs as it will raise the chances of getting selected and provide a better structure to your CDR creating a good impression. If not many, at least 2 designs can be mentioned about with all the details provided.</p>
					<p>The CDR report must also include any codes or standards you followed. Workshops and any sort of training attended and the software used must also be mentioned. All this makes your CDR more authentic and provides for better chances of selection. </p>
					<p>Clearly mention about any seminars, presentations, workshops or meetings that you attended as part of the project and the knowledge you gained from there. You could also provide details of your presentation to the clients and such work.</p>
					<p>The CDR is all about your personal and professional achievements whether significant or insignificant. The training and achievements depict your dedication in the field, and it is on the basis of your knowledge that EA authorities would select you by providing the score. </p>
					<p>You could also mention of social and economic welfare and environmental initiatives which you could have taken during any of the Career Episode.</p>
					<p>Instead of copying content, you should put down facts which would be backed by authentic documents and support so that you are able to defend your work, if asked about it, confidently. </p>
					<p>Any aspiring Engineer who wishes to migrate to Australia must provide a Competency Demonstration Report which is a detailed report of the engineering skills of the candidate. However, a key point which marks the acceptance or rejection of the application is the determination to the candidate for migrating to Australia. </p>
					<p>It is quite obvious that the CDR assesses the achievements, skills, qualifications and competencies of an engineer. This shows the assessors what you are worthy of and how important you can be to their economy. </p>
					<h3>A CDR basically comprises of different sections which can be grouped into 4 categories</h3>

					<ul class="list10">
					<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>Resume: A basic, detailed CV with a bio, qualifications, experience, references, and skills</li>
					<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>Continuing Professional Development: A report of the workshops, conferences, and meetings attended as well as any accolades received.
					<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>Career Episodes: Three critical engineering episodes depicting your skills and technology and make you an asset for the company you join.
					<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>Summary: A detailed report related to the CDR which is the main part of the entire document.
					</ul>
					<p>Preparing a CDR report is a time taking a process which takes the effort to be completed. Engineers, often cannot realize the importance of following the guidelines and providing all the details according to the rules mentioned in the Migration Skills Assessment Booklet which is easily available online. Inability to present the report according to the rules and regulations and filling it up with negligence may lead to rejection of the report and a full stop to your dreams.</p>
					<p> EA Australia experts take the CDR report very seriously and are strict when it comes to assessment and judgment. Every detail provided by you is checked thoroughly, and you should be careful to select only those career episodes for which you have enough raw data and support. If you want help in filling your CDR report, you should discuss with professionals and refer to samples and also take help from online CDR writers.</p>

          <h3>The 10 commandments to write a CDR Report</h3>
					<ul class="list10">
					<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>Read the booklet: The MSA booklet provides all the help, intricacy and guidelines on how to write a CDR with no errors. It explains the importance of each section in detail, the way it should be filled, the ideal word count and the correct format of each section, and the requisites needed to complete the application with emphasis on the do’s and dont’s.</li>
					<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>Keep the Proofs: Make sure that you have authentic certificates, testimonials, and back up support for any the information you provide in the CDR. The absence of any document that you may be asked for may lead to rejection of your application and barring you to apply any further. </li>
					<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>Don’t Copy Paste: Avoid plagiarism and check your document thoroughly before submitting. However, sophisticated the English might be, you cannot use the sentences framed and published on the internet. If caught it becomes a big negative point on the side of the applicant. 
					<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>Language: The application should be preferably published in Australian English and if not then in British English according to the guidelines of EA. However, Australian English is still preferred. American English cannot be used since the tone of the language makes it unfit for use in formal proceedings.
					<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>Career Episodes: One of the most important parts of a CDR is the Career Episodes which should highlight the top three most important episodes of your engineering career. These episodes must be able to showcase your technical and knowledge skills as well as your leadership qualities and efficiency as a risk manager and quality controller. This is the one section that gives you an opportunity to show your abilities and make yourself known of your worth as well as ensure your importance in whichever company you may join. 
					<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>Continuing Professional Development: This is where you should provide a list of the workshops and seminars attended by you and build your graph in terms of knowledge acquired and still in the learning process to show your enthusiasm for the field. You must prepare it in a tabular form and keep to the word limit mentioning briefly about every workshop attended and the skills attained.
					<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>Health and Safety: You should also depict how you can get along with human and other resources in your job and deal with them in case of an emergency on the worksite.
					<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>No over description: You should keep the report within the word limit and avoid over description as it is not taken too well by EA authorities. You should provide crisp, clear and to the point data which shows your abilities which are depicted in the career episodes.
					<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>Highlight yourself: The CDR report must be strictly prepared in the first person and active voice. It should be about you and not about the team for the authorities would want to assess you on the application submitted by you. So, it does not require details of your team and the history of your company.
					<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>Design and fit for the job: Choose the subject you have qualified in and are applying and provide the required details instead of beating around the bush. Try to read the job requisites and what they are actually looking for so that you can project your skills and expertise properly so that they are able to assess you carefully.  
					</ul>
					<p>If you can complete your CDR according to these 10 commandments, it is highly probable that you will be selected provided you fulfill all the details. Applications are rejected due to lack of attention to detail in the CDR, and poor presentation. You will get the chance to meet the authorities once, and you should ensure to make a one-time impression to be selected in the first chance. So, you should avoid any loophole and fill in the CDR report with prime importance. </p>
					<p>If you are unsure of the CDR report you have prepared, you must seek for professional help. You can ask online service providers and experts to review your application or provide them the details to prepare your CDR report. They will be able to provide you with an error-free and authentic document well in time. </p>
					<p>Whenever filling up the CDR, you must keep the following ten items in your Career Episode to ensure a positive selection.</p>

					<h3>Attributes of an Excellent CDR Report</h3>

					<ul class="list10">
					<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>Company name, background and location, history, your position in the company, the objectives of the project Objectives, duration, 
					<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>Details of 7 responsibilities as per ANZSCO Code (as per your engineering discipline)
					<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>Problems of Engineering/ Technical attributes faced & Solutions offered
					<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>Design Components (highly important to mention at least two design items)
					<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>Engineering/ Technical Calculations (what types (names), how performed, results), Codes/ Standards, Software used,
					<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>Training and Meetings attended, Presentations, Documentation, Workshops, and Conferences
					<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>Team Work, Dealing, Innovation, 
					<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>Health, & Safety considerations, Environment and Social activity
					<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>Professional Achievements, Awards, and goals fulfilled
					</ul>

					<h3>Avoid Rejection</h3>

					<p>It is important to first go through the guidelines laid down by Engineers Australia. Most of the applications get rejected due to an inability to prepare the document by following the updated criteria or requirements of Engineers Australia. Lack of time and effort on the part of candidates, lack of proficiency in English, plagiarism are some of the common factors of rejection. The assessing authorities use plagiarism detection software which can reveal copied material from any published report. You must follow the ten commandments given to prepare your CDR report. </p>
					<p>The career episodes must be prepared in paragraphs, and each paragraph in Career Episode should be given separate code that should be correlated with the Summary Statement.</p>
					<p>Online professionals make it a point to teach engineers of the importance of CDR report. They offer service of Plagiarism Checking and Plagiarism Removal in the previously prepared Competency Demonstration Reports at a very nominal charge.
