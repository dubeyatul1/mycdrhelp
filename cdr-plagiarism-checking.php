                  <p>While writing Competency Demonstration Report, many candidates won’t give importance to plagiarism. They often copy contents from different sources and complete their report. Once they submit this copied data to the Engineers Australia (EA), it is likely that they will reject the report at a glance. In this way, there are many engineering candidates whose reports won’t make the cut and they have to accept failure in their reports.</p>
                  
                  <p>2:If you want to avoid this troublesome situation and want to prepare a unique report, you must take the help of experts. You can also refer multiple references and create your report by using your own writing skills. However, there might be the same issue of copied content. In order to get rid of plagiarism, you must hire professionals and submit it to EA with confidence.</p>

Engineers Australia is very strict when it comes to CDR assessment and you cannot get your hands off easily once you are found guilty.
