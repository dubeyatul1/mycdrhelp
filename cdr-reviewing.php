                  <p>There are a huge number of CDR reports which gets rejected every year in Australia by EA. Even after preparing your CDR report properly, stating all three of your career stages, and creating a well-written summary statement, when you send your CDR to EA for verification, in most cases, it gets rejected. Now, you must be wondering why that happens. Well, there are a number of reasons as to why that happens.</p>
                  <h3>Some Common Mistakes in CDR Preparation</h3>
                  <p>When candidates prepare CDR in order to apply for a particular post in a reputed organization, there are some common mistakes they make. These mistakes almost end their chances of getting the post they want in that very organization. <br/><b>Let’s have a look at the mistakes they make:</b></p>
                  <ul class="list10">
                    <li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Skipping important information</li>
                    <li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Copying an already published work</li>
                    <li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Miscalculations and wrongly placed information in the tables</li>
                    <li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> No link between the data of Summary Statement and CDR</li>
                    <li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Wrong information of career stages</li>
                    <li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Vaguely stated career goals</li>
                    <li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Grammatical errors and spelling mistakes</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>If your CDR is written in this manner then you will see that EA has rejected it. However, there is a way in which you can avoid this hassle of rejection and re-submission.Please contact our live chat Engineers.</p>

					       <h3>What and how to respond to EA if you got similarities in your career episodes</h3>
			               <img src="<?php echo $baseUrl;?>images/CDR-reviewing-services.png" class="img-responsive" alt="CDR writing help">
						   <br/>
						   <br/>
						   <br/>
                            <p>If somebody gets a reply on behalf of EA that gathered responses across CE have similarities that relate with the sources then someone accountable for that should consider one lucky if they have a chance of explaining their work. Similarly, the originality index should be proven otherwise your work would be designated as invalid and a ban might be applied or application for the same could be required thereby requiring $s for new application.  </p>
							<p><b>Similar situation is faced by me that could help you with the proceedings while going by the shared experience.</b></p>
							<p>Situation tends to arise when you are copying stuff from online sources which could be CDR’s, magazine, books, published papers or anything that is available across online portals. </p>
							<p><b>Under no situation one should copy content from CDRs and Websites.</b></p>
							<p>You are eligible to go through them and cite information as per own words.</p>
							<p><b>Similarities Explanation:</b></p>
                            <ol>
							<li><p>If a case of copying from CDR arises then never accept to it, rather denote that you have went by CDR and consulted the same while it accounted to be ethically negative as compared to other sources.</p></li>
							<li><p>You are liable to know which portions are copied in your CDR therefore there is no need to highlight the same and explain it. In contrast, try to focus on the set of activities and tasks that you have done entirely on your own thereby keeping the focus across that only.</p></li>
							<li><p>In order to ensure that you have went by the project activities all by your own; you can take notable evidence of the associated elements that usually lies in the form of drawings, calculations and write up of literature in relevance to the project. Therefore, scanning the subjective evidences would develop to be beneficial in the project development process.</p>
							<p>This would automatically cater to the fact that the entire project work is done in an authentic manner thereby solidifying the project work in front of assessor. Therefore, presentation of the materials referred to needs to be wonderful. There was inclusion of drawings that were not in good condition, literature did not really followed suit of English language whereas the notebook demarcated the poor condition of it due to four years of usage. Lastly, I scanned and sent forth 20 pages of it to the assessor.	</p>
							</li>
							<li><p>If any product across CDRs is highlighted or a machine is being highlighted upon as a standard unit then everyone is eligible to highlight it. For example, ABB motor is used over my application in the project and CDR that might as well match up with other candidate’s selection of the same as well. Therefore, those elements need to be marked across the CDR thereby leading to the search of the same for finding common sources that have a global standard. This would ensure that the content might be copied from existing literature that has an overall standard value.</p>
							<p>The assessors asking of the sources should be dealt with effectively by handing out the common set of materials that were used across the project as they should match up with the sources of other individuals too.</p>
							<p>Provision of web links, in general 2-3 is crucial for the explanation of the project actions, e.g. ABB motor guidelines for installation (CDR was based over motor therefore it is being used by me).</p>
							<p>Never cite that you have copied from other sources rather outline that you have taken help from the standardized activities and consulted them. </p>
							</li>
							<li><p>A mention of safety measures across the CDR should be cited as well and linked with regular standards such as the OHSAS safety norm or many others. It should be mentioned because it has become a common element and the application of safety strategies is starting to be usual too.</p></li>
							<li><p>In relation to the introduction of the project some set of sources may also be referred from you.</p></li>
							<li><p>A collection of a certificate from the professor or an organization (scenario dependent) would ensure that the entire project is done in a legit manner without having any discrepancies. It would also make it beneficial. However, the in charge person should be your boss as shown forth across CDR hierarchical chart.</p></li>
						</ol>
                          <p>Point #4, 5 and 6: Materials for these points can be easily found across the internet as they are common elements across any project process. Links for these portions are mentioned whereas rest of the portion is written by me. Standards and Literature are units across CDR that should match with other participants and highlighting should be done across it. Sources should be provided to the assessor while creation of a new one is must without copying.</p>
						  <p>We at www.MyCDRHelp.com take special care of the Plagiarism and we provide Plagiarism/Turnitin report with each document of your CDR to ensure and as a proof of 100% Plagiarism free work.</p>

					  <h3>How would MyCDRHelp.com help in CDR Reviewing?</h3>
								<p>Plagiarism, inadequate structure, lack of basic details, and meaningless facts in career episodes are the most critical factors for CDR refusal. Although, all these things are given special consideration during the analysis of the CDR to ensure the consistency is of the highest level. Our review service includes proofreading, editing, plagiarism check and removal. We focus on following issues during the CDR analysis</p>
								<p><b>Technicalities:</b> The CDR must have all the technical elements needed to show your engineering skills as well as knowledge, according to the guidelines from Engineers Australia. At CDRReportwriters.com, we ensure that the CDR contains the relevant parts that must be addressed in detail.</p>
								<p><b>Report Structure:</b> Australian Engineers has strict CDR Structure guidelines. We therefore carefully monitor the framework of the CDR to ensure that it conforms to the EA specification.</p>
								<p><b>Flow:</b> Anomalies must be stripped of the sequence of events and functions seen in the CDR. We make sure that your CDR holds maximum flow.</p>
								<p><b>Plagiarism Check and Removal:</b> Plagiarism is a huge reason why Engineers Australia has rejected most of the CDR submitted. We use state-of-the-art tools to identify first the sum of plagiarized contents on your CDR and then delete it to original and exclusive material.</p>
								<p><b>Proofreading and Editing:</b> To detect spelling errors, we revised each section of the CDR. Grammatical faults and failures in printing and then writing appropriately.</p>

					  <h3>What Happens to a Wrongly Written CDR?</h3>

					  <p>When you send a CDR to EA for review and if it is filled with mistakes, then you might get rejected or get considered for a lower post that what you have applied for. Professional Engineer, Engineering Manager, Engineering Associate and Engineering Technologist, these are the four categories for which you will apply as an engineer in Australia. If your CDR if filled with Mistake or Plagiarised then the EA will consider you for an associate’s post even if you are qualified for a higher post or in the worst case scenario, your application might get rejected and you will get informed to resubmit it for a lower position. When you avail our services for the CDR review, you just eliminate these chances of rejection.</p>

All the three CEs have to be drawn from different periods of your engineering work or showcase different aspects of your experience as an engineer. Do not forget to use Australian English while writing CDR report.The guidelines of Migration Skill Assessment states that the career episode must be written within 1000 to 2500 words. But, more often than not this word limit gets surpassed.</p>

                  <p>Once you submit your CDR to Engineers Australia, they might reject it and ask you to make the necessary corrections and editing and resubmit for another lesser category than what you had initially applied. Four categories where engineers develop a CDR and submit to EA are Professional Engineer, Engineering Manager, Engineering Associate and Engineering Technologist.</p>
                  <p>If your CDR has a mistake which catches the attention of EA they might assess you for a position of Associate even if you have four-year bachelor’s degree and are much more qualified or they might simply reject you. Even if you get assessed for another category, they might not invite you to the interview. Even with the qualification and hard work, you might not get the job due to an ill-prepared CDR. Therefore, it is necessary to avail of CDR review services to get your CDR report proofread and checked.</p>

                                   <p>Many of the applicants commit this common error while writing career episodes. As per the requirement by the Engineers Australia (EA), you need to describe one full project in each Career Episode.</p> 
                                   <p>However, the applicants often present the same project separately in two different divisions and add each section in each one of the Career Episodes.

						 <h3>Things to consider before hiring a CDR writer </h3>

A writer by engineering background can easily understand the CDR requirements which are put forward by the Engineer Australia. It takes an engineer to pass the engineering assessment. You need to careful not to risk your application by hiring a writer rather than an engineer with writing skills. </p>
					   <p><b>CDR Writing service provider should be familiar with the Immigration program:</b></p>
