You will also require submitting a top-notch quality CDR report for Electrical Engineer (233512).</p>
						
						<h2 class="sample_heading">What makes a Good and EA acceptable CDR Report?</h2>
						<p>Here are a few characteristics that make a good CDR Report:</p>
						<ul class="list10">
						<li>When it comes to the CDR report, the Career Episodes must mention your skills as a Professional Engineer, Engineering Manager, Engineer Associate, and Engineering Technologist with utmost perfection. Hence you must pick your career episodes wisely so that it makes your CDR report stand out and prove your competency for the engineering category you are applying in.</li>
						<li>Remember, the EA assessor analyses your communication skills through the report. So avoid any grammatical, syntax, or punctuation errors and use proper Australian English.</li>
						<li>Be precise with the information you write in your CDR report. Engineers Australia has no interest in the history of your work or your achievements. What they look for is to know more about your role as an engineer in the company and your contributions to the project you undertook.</li>
						<li>You must be prepared to verify the claims you make in the report in the form of evidence and document.</li>
						<li>EA prefers a prescriptive writing style for Career Episodes. These episodes should be written in the first person - in an active voice. It means that you should use words as <i>I researched, I planned, I handled, etc.</i></li>
						<li>As per Engineers Australia, one crucial part of the CDR report is a Summary Statement, which must be relevant to the career episodes you write in your report. Make sure all the aspects of your CDR report is related to the competency elements required for the Skilled Migration Category.</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="para">Also, another crucial factor you must keep in mind while writing your CDR report is to mention the technical problems you faced while working on the project, explain if not handled well by you, how it could have incurred huge losses to your company. Write about your role in solving the problem as an engineer and the awards or recognition you received for putting in the efforts.</p>
						<p class="cenb"><i>It is crucial for you to write CDR Report in a well defined proven format according to the competency standards setup by the Engineers Australia. Those candidates, who are unaware of these guidelines, often fail to make it to the migration list. We, at My CDR Help, can help you to create an impressive and fully acceptable CDR within a few days.</i></p>
						
						<h2 class="sample_heading">Find out here how to write the best career episodes for your CDR report:</h2>
						<p>Engineers Australia requires you to write three career episodes in your CDR report for electrical engineers. Since EA will analyse it to understand your competency and skills, you must write them with utmost precision and make sure you pick the best three career episodes from your career which can highlight your skills, leadership qualities, and expertise in the field. You can also refer to our CDR report sample available for a electrical engineer to understand the format or to eliminate any confusion.</p>
						<p class="cenb"><i>We have committed Native Engineering experts for all Engineering subjects who have already qualified EA assessment in the first attempt.</i></p>
						<h2 class="sample_heading">How to Write the Three Career Episodes as per MSA?</h2>
						<p class="cenb">Career Episode composition is a critical part of your Competency Demonstration Report (CDR) – required by Engineers Australia (EA) to pass judgment on whether your Engineering aptitudes and information coordinate the Australian principles or not.</p>
						<p>A career episode proves your competency and demonstrates your work experience and your engineering abilities. Each career episode you pick must be focused on a specific period and highlight your abilities and skills in engineering activity. The episode you pick must demonstrate how you used your skills, expertise, and engineering knowledge in the nominated occupation.</p>
						<p> You may pick a career episode based on:</p>
						<ul class="list10">
						<li>an engineering task was undertaken by you during your educational program;</li>
						<li>a project you are currently working on related to electrical engineering or have worked on.</li>
						<li>any particular position that you are currently on or occupied in the past, but it should just comprise a mere duty statement</li>
						<li>an engineering-related problem you solved</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Make sure that you write your career episode in proper English and do not copy and paste content from CDR reports sample available online. It will also prove your communication skills abilities to the assessor.</p>
						<p>Just keep the narrative short and remember that EA is not interested in your work history. They just need you to mention your best three career episodes. The narrative must be 1000 to 2500 words.</p>
						<p>Each career episode should speak about your engineering skills and abilities and how you applied them for achieving the desired outcomes. Explain what you did, how you achieved the results. Do not use too many technical details. Write in active voice and first-person (for example- I resolved, I handled).</p>
						<p>The career episode you pick must highlight any engineering-related problem handled by you and the techniques you used to solve it. It will help assessors to acknowledge your contribution in executing project and task objectives.</p>
						<ul class="list10">
						<li>Technical problems and difficulties identified by you and your approach to resolving it</li>
						<li>Any strategy or creative design work by you to solve the issue </li>
						<li>How you coordinated and teamed up with other team members</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Number each paragraph you write in your career episode. This helps you refer to the paragraphs while writing the summary statement. The following system is recommended: </p>
						<p>Career episode 1 (paragraphs 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 etc.)</p>
						<p>Career episode 2 (paragraphs 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 etc.) </p>
						<p>Career episode 3 (paragraphs 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 etc.)</p>
						<p>Please Note: Career episode plays a crucial role in your CDR report. So use it wisely and explain your role and the inputs you gave in resolving the technical issues you faced. </p>

                        <h2 class="sample_heading">Top 10 Expert Advices to Write a Perfect CDR Report for Engineers Australia</h2>	
						<p class="cenb"><i>Understanding of the process thoroughly, can get one’s CDR accepted by EA in the first attempt. To put this in a different way, the What’s, How’s and Why’s of the whole process should be properly understood</i></p>
						<p>It is an undeniable fact that writing a Competency Demonstration Report for Skilled Migration Visa to Australia requires expertise; hence you must not miss any technicalities or guidelines stated by Engineers Australia (EA). Remember, even a minute mistake can lead your CDR report to rejection. So make sure you provide EA with an authentic and uniquely written CDR report. Also, you must avoid misrepresentation of any information at any cost. Do not use bits and pieces of any CDR Report sample available online as even slight plagiarism can make EA reject your CDR report right away. To avoid any chances of rejection, you can always consider taking the help of CDR plagiarism checking and removal services available.</p>
						<p>Here are the top 10 bits of advice explained by our best CDR writing experts that will surely help you get an Australian Visa without any hassle:</p>
						<p>1. Be very precise and clear while mentioning the project in your career episode, and don’t forget to write the details about the company or organization you have worked with. It must include:</p>
						<ul class="list10">
						<li>Project Objectives</li>
						<li>Details about the Company & location</li>
						<li>Company’s background </li>
						<li>Your Career Stage (Mention if you were studying at the time, or if it was the first job, or if you were working at a middle-management position at the time of the Career Episode you chose to write about) </li>
						<li>Mention details like how long was the project or the duration of it. </li>
						<li>What was your position in the Project Hierarchy? </li>
						</ul>

						<p>Include at least five to six of the tasks and don’t forget to refer to them when you write the summary statement.</p>
						<p>Read all the instructions and guidelines stated by Engineers Australia carefully and do not miss to number the paragraphs you write for Career Episodes. It will help you refer to the Career Episodes with ease while writing the Summary Statement. Don’t forget to use the active voice in Career Episodes and write in the first person.</p>
						<p>3. Keep the purpose of writing the CDR report very clear in mind. All that EA is looking for is to analyze how you handled the technical challenges you faced during your work tenure and your competency in the selected engineering field. The challenges you mention must be relevant to the engineering discipline tasks as mentioned in the ANZSCO codes.</p>
						<p>4. Focus more on areas that carry high weightage in the skill assessment. Mention any two most important designs you have worked on and then explain all the details related to them.</p>
						<p>5. Maintain track of all the technical calculations you did during the project. What were the results and write about your approach towards the problem and how you solved it? Explain in detail and refer to them while working on the Summary Statement.</p>
						<p>6. Write about the Standards or Codes you used, training that you have attended or the tools or software you used. It brings authenticity to your report and proves your credibility as an engineer.</p>
						<p>7. For the CPD list, you can list the presentations, workshops, or seminars you attended. It is always wise to showcase the literature review or the documentation as well or presentations, if any, given by you to the clients or any other stakeholders associated with the project. It will help in explaining how committed and dedicated you were to your profession.</p>
						<p>8. EA looks for many positive personality traits in a potential Visa 189 candidate that include how you dealt with the team members or how you valued your team participation and their role, and most importantly your capability to lead the team. If you can prove how you helped your company to prevent losses by coming up with the right solutions, EA will surely award you some additional points.</p>
						<p>9. Other than the technical difficulties, it would be great if you can write about how you handled health, environmental, or safety-related regulations and policies in any of your career episodes. Any social activity organized or participated by you to comply with the environment or similar activities can be mentioned here.</p>

              <h2 class="sample_heading">What is CDR?</h2>
              <p><strong>A CDR report is termed to be a vessel by virtue of which the engineers can get hold of their VISA regarding skilled migrations within Australia. Through such, the engineers can provide a proof regarding their competencies. EA that is Engineers Australia, being the authority for undertaking assessment regarding applications for skilled immigration, provides help on the preparation of CDR report.</strong></p>
              <p>The CDR is a necessary document for engineers who hope to achieve an extremely successful career abroad. But the first step is to provide a written CDR sample document.</p>
              <p>"CDR" means the Competency Demonstration Report. The Australian Engineers Institute is responsible for the CDR. This is only required if you are an immigrant or not a member of the Sydney Agreement, the Washington Agreement or the Dublin Agreement. If you want to immigrate to Australia as an engineer, you must ensure that your report must meet all the requirements or requirements contained in the book "Assessment of Migration Skills" published by EA or Engineers Australia.</p>
                             
              <h2 class="sample_heading">The CDR consists of three parts:</h2>
                             
              <p><strong>Continuing professional development:</strong></p>
              <p>It is a tabular form of what we did earlier in the course of our work, which helped us develop or help us grow in the future. We can add all the workshops, seminars and lectures we participated in, which helped us to understand our field and helped us develop in our career.</p>
                             
              <p><strong>Career Episodes:</strong></p>
              <p>Career Episode composition is a critical part of your Competency Demonstration Report (CDR) – required by Engineers Australia (EA) to pass judgment on whether your Engineering aptitudes and information coordinate the Australian principles or not</p>
              <p>The three career episodes concern our contributions to group projects and projects that we have been doing so far. It is about additional projects in which we participated. We can write about everything we've done, and even if it was a team project, we need to determine what our contribution was and what our work in this project was.They do not want very difficult experiences, but they want to know how we are with people and how we can work if we find ourselves in this situation. An essay from 1000 – 2000 words is enough to inform them of our contribution in such areas.</p>
                            
                             <p><strong>Summary Statement :</strong></p>
                             <p>Summary of the place where you highlight the role that we played or the projects we have worked on. This is the place where we can determine the evaluator, the type of quality we used in this situation, and the area we want to emphasize. Therefore, each paragraph in the section of the three careers section should be written exceptionally. It is also very crucial to mention our personal data, education, and employment history. Creating a CDR can be compared to taking a resume for a company.</p>
                             <p><strong>"The CDR would require additional points and paragraphs, but it is very similar to a CV."</strong></p>
                    
                             <h2 class="sample_heading">Some Important Facts about CDR Report</h2>
                             <p>Understanding of the process thoroughly, can get one’s CDR accepted by EA in the first attempt. To put this in a different way, the What’s, How’s and Why’s of the whole process should be properly understood</p>
                             <p>The CDR rating is based mainly on our undergraduate qualifications and our Master's competences. The evaluation method and parameters are different for each position. They expect from a professional engineer that they will be able to cope with the risk, but they know about the limitations and costs of the project. They are innovators and heralds of change and improvement.</p>
                             <p>It is expected that a technology engineer will know about new technologies related to their domain. They do not need an innovative mind, such as professional engineers, and they still think and solve difficult problems.</p> 
                             <p>A technical employee is tasked with dealing with the safe and cost-effective operation of devices. They play different roles in engineering companies ranging from feasibility studies to design and development. It is expected that they will have good knowledge of engineering sciences and rules related to their area of specialization.</p>
                             <p>The Technical Manager is to formulate strategies, policies, and engineering plans. They should guide others and help them when they are needed. To achieve this level, the applicant is expected to be at least at the level of a professional engineer.</p>
                             <p>The combined hard work of all these people is successful completion of the project. If you want to find a job at one of these positions, you must first go through the engineering group of Australia and present a sufficiently good CDR, which will satisfy the assessors who will provide you with the work you expect. And, we are here to help you in preparing the most valuable competency demonstration report.</p>
                             <p>The competition will be difficult everywhere if the work is respected and in the right place, but competition can be destroyed if we have a good CDR, which highlights a professional image of us and which makes the assessor want to give us the job we want in an easy way.</p>
                             <p>There are some key segments of CDR composing that make it troublesome for hopeful engineers to finish in a viable way. Our expert CDR coaches help in meeting those prerequisites and finishing the areas in the accompanying way and as per EA guidelines</p>

                           <p>When the CDR is not written in accordance with the guidelines and requirements of the Engineers Australia, the assessor rejects it.

                          <p>With each of the documents as mentioned earlier those are submitted before immigration officials are essential. Documents along with a sample of a CDR for a biomedical engineer must be okay, no doubt that you would pass the CDR.</p>
                          <p>Any resignation from sending one of these documents would undoubtedly be the reason for ending our aspirations to work in Australia because your application will indeed be rejected.</p>
                          <p>It is crucial for you to write CDR Report in a well defined proven format according to the competency standards setup by the Engineers Australia. Those candidates, who are unaware of these guidelines, often fail to make it to the migration list. We, at My CDR Help, can help you to create an impressive and fully acceptable CDR within a few days</p>

TOEFL has two types of examinations. The first is the internet based test which is known as TOEFL-IBT and the other one is the paper based offline exam known as TOEFL-PBT. These tests evaluate proficiency of a person in four sections, which is reading, speaking, listening and writing. 30 marks are allotted for each and every section. All the evaluations are done to convince the authorities about academic proficiency with the language itself. It will take four hours to completely go through the test. Someone can get a Skilled Visa with at least a score of 24 for reading and listening section while the score for writing is 27 and the score for speaking is 23.</p>
