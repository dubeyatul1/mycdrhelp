                                  <p>Within the career episode in first stage, a description was given by the author regarding his project. The project was pursued by author while he was pursuing his Bachelor’s degree on Agriculture Engineering. The project was titled to be “Application of Multi-Hazard Seismic-Blast Detailing for Highway Bridges”. Regarding the pursuing of project, few responsibilities were imposed on the author. The first responsibility of the author was to provide an investigation on effects of blast loads. The investigation was to be referred towards a typical bridge on the highway within United States. The next responsibility was the identification of mechanisms that were subjective for the damage/failure causes to components of the bridge. He was also to study the existing correlations between designs that are seismic regarding effects of blast loads. Further, he was responsible for presenting targets on hypothetical bridge. They were subjected to different blast loading levels for the investigation of mechanism of failures in the blast induced. On further context, the author was also responsible for discussing the seismic detailing applications regarding the bridges on highways that are blast induced.</p>

The skills were used by author for the completion of his project within a given time period of 5 months as being a student of final year. The project was titled to be “Vertical Transport Evacuation Modelling”. There were few responsibilities for the author regarding the pursuing of project. His first responsibility was to provide a review done in-depth. The review was to be in relevance to the evacuation usage consulting the devices of vertical transport within the actual practise of evacuation. Next, the author was responsible for providing a demonstration. The demonstration would be regarding the influences of various sorts of strategies consulting vertical transports. Further he was responsible for the advancement of procuring understandings regarding the human factors. The factors are subjective to have association with usage of escalators. It was also in alignment with the operational strategic influences while practising evacuations. On further context, the author was responsible to undertake analysis regarding the other present strategies regarding operations.</p>

He was responsible for the designing as well as evaluation of structural capacity consulting the system of guardrails with span length increased. Further, he was responsible for the determination of unsupported maximum span length regarding the designs of on-going long-span. He was to undertake evaluation regarding the potential modifications. The modifications are to be subjected for allowing unsupported spans on longer basis. He was responsible for meeting the tests on 3rd level (TL-3) criteria for safety. The criterion was set by American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO). It was set through their Manual made in relevance to Assessing Safety Hardware (MASH).</p>
