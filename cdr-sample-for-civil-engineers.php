What they look for is to know more about your role as an engineer in the company and your contributions to the project you undertook.</li>
					   <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>You must be prepared to verify the claims you make in the report in the form of evidence and documents. </li>
					   <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>EA prefers a prescriptive writing style for Career Episodes. These episodes should be written in the first person - in an active voice. It means that you should use words as <i>I researched, I planned, I handled,etc.</i></li>
					   <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>As per Engineers Australia, one crucial part of the CDR report is a Summary Statement, which must be relevant to the career episodes you write in your report. Make sure all the aspects of your CDR report is related to the competency elements required for the Skilled Migration Category.</li>
					   </ul>
					   <p>Also, another crucial factor you must keep in mind while writing your CDR report is to mention the technical problems you faced while working on the project, explain if not handled well by you, how it could have incurred huge losses to your company. Write about your role in solving the problem as an engineer and the awards or recognition you received for putting in the efforts.</p>

						<h3>How to Write the Three Career Episodes as per MSA?</h3>
						<p class="cenb">Career Episode composition is a critical part of your Competency Demonstration Report (CDR) – required by Engineers Australia (EA) to pass judgment on whether your Engineering aptitudes and information coordinate the Australian principles or not.</p>
						<p>A career episode proves your competency and demonstrates your work experience and your engineering abilities. Each career episode you pick must be focused on a specific period and highlight your abilities and skills in engineering activity. The episode you pick must demonstrate how you used your skills, expertise, and engineering knowledge in the nominated occupation.</p>
						<p> You may pick a career episode based on:</p>
						<ul class="list10">
						<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>an engineering task was undertaken by you during your educational program;</li>
						<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>a project you are currently working on related to mining engineering or have worked on.</li>
						<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>any particular position that you are currently on or occupied in the past, but it should just comprise a mere duty statement</li>
						<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>an engineering-related problem you solved</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Make sure that you write your career episode in proper English and do not copy and paste content from CDR reports sample available online. It will also prove your communication skills abilities to the assessor.</p>
						<p>Just keep the narrative short and remember that EA is not interested in your work history. They just need you to mention your best three career episodes. The narrative must be 1000 to 2500 words.</p>
						<p>Each career episode should speak about your engineering skills and abilities and how you applied them for achieving the desired outcomes. Explain what you did, how you achieved the results. Do not use too many technical details. Write in active voice and first-person (for example- I resolved, I handled).</p>
						<p>The career episode you pick must highlight any engineering-related problem handled by you and the techniques you used to solve it. It will help assessors to acknowledge your contribution in executing project and task objectives.</p>
						<ul class="list10">
						<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Technical problems and difficulties identified by you and your approach to resolving it</li>
						<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Any strategy or creative design work by you to solve the issue </li>
						<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>How you coordinated and teamed up with other team members</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Number each paragraph you write in your career episode. This helps you refer to the paragraphs while writing the summary statement. The following system is recommended:</p>
						<p>Career episode 1 (paragraphs 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 etc.)</p>
						<p>Career episode 2 (paragraphs 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 etc.)</p>
						<p>Career episode 3 (paragraphs 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 etc.)</p>
						<p>Please Note: Career episode plays a crucial role in your CDR report. So use it wisely and explain your role and the inputs you gave in resolving the technical issues you faced.</p>

					    <h3>Top 10 Expert Advices to Write a Perfect CDR Report for Engineers Australia</h3>	
						<p class="cenb"><i>Understanding of the process thoroughly, can get one’s CDR accepted by EA in the first attempt. To put this in a different way, the What’s, How’s and Why’s of the whole process should be properly understood</i></p>
						<p>It is an undeniable fact that writing a Competency Demonstration Report for Skilled Migration Visa to Australia requires expertise; hence you must not miss any technicalities or guidelines stated by Engineers Australia (EA). Remember, even a minute mistake can lead your CDR report to rejection. So make sure you provide EA with an authentic and uniquely written CDR report. Also, you must avoid misrepresentation of any information at any cost. Do not use bits and pieces of any CDR Report sample available online as even slight plagiarism can make EA reject your CDR report right away. To avoid any chances of rejection, you can always consider taking the help of CDR plagiarism checking and removal services available.</p>
						<p>Here are the top 10 bits of advice explained by our best CDR writing experts that will surely help you get an Australian Visa without any hassle:</p>
						<p>1. Be very precise and clear while mentioning the project in your career episode, and don’t forget to write the details about the company or organization you have worked with. It must include:</p>
						<ul class="list10">
						<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Project Objectives</li>
						<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Details about the Company & location</li>
						<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Company’s background </li>
						<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Your Career Stage (Mention if you were studying at the time, or if it was the first job, or if you were working at a middle-management position at the time of the Career Episode you chose to write about) </li>
						<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Mention details like how long was the project or the duration of it.</li>
						<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> was your position in the Project Hierarchy? </li>
						</ul>
						<p>2. Go through the ANZSCO Code of the engineering discipline you choose. Read about it in detail and make sure you cover all the aspects and the responsibilities it mentions.</p>
						<p>Include at least five to six of the tasks and don’t forget to refer to them when you write the summary statement.</p>
						<p>Read all the instructions and guidelines stated by Engineers Australia carefully and do not miss to number the paragraphs you write for Career Episodes. It will help you refer to the Career Episodes with ease while writing the Summary Statement. Don’t forget to use the active voice in Career Episodes and write in the first person.</p>
						<p>3. Keep the purpose of writing the CDR report very clear in mind. All that EA is looking for is to analyze how you handled the technical challenges you faced during your work tenure and your competency in the selected engineering field. The challenges you mention must be relevant to the engineering discipline tasks as mentioned in the ANZSCO codes.</p>
						<p>4. Focus more on areas that carry high weightage in the skill assessment. Mention any two most important designs you have worked on and then explain all the details related to them.</p>
						<p>5. Maintain track of all the technical calculations you did during the project. What were the results and write about your approach towards the problem and how you solved it? Explain in detail and refer to them while working on the Summary Statement.</p>
						<p>6. Write about the Standards or Codes you used, training that you have attended or the tools or software you used. It brings authenticity to your report and proves your credibility as an engineer.</p>
						<p>7. For the CPD list, you can list the presentations, workshops, or seminars you attended. It is always wise to showcase the literature review or the documentation as well or presentations, if any, given by you to the clients or any other stakeholders associated with the project. It will help in explaining how committed and dedicated you were to your profession.</p>
						<p>8. EA looks for many positive personality traits in a potential Visa 189 candidate that include how you dealt with the team members or how you valued your team participation and their role, and most importantly your capability to lead the team. If you can prove how you helped your company to prevent losses by coming up with the right solutions, EA will surely award you some additional points.</p>
						<p>9. Other than the technical difficulties, it would be great if you can write about how you handled health, environmental, or safety-related regulations and policies in any of your career episodes. Any social activity organized or participated by you to comply with the environment or similar activities can be mentioned here.</p>
						<p>10. Last but not least, you must not miss writing about your professional achievements after writing the Career Episodes. You can mention the project outcomes, recognition, or awards for your contribution, or targets achieved.</p>

					<p>Civil engineers critically examine the complex projects and enjoy the fruit of all their hard work when the said task reaches to its completion stage.<br/> <b>They generally excel in the below mentioned areas -</b></p>
				    <ul class="list10">
					<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i><strong>Construction engineers</strong> look after the projects of construction, in order to ensure that the said project caters to the standard laid down and the specifications mentioned therein. The efficiency of the temporary structures build in order to help in the construction projects, is the sole responsibility of the construction engineers. The may also supervise the budget, communication tools and overall time management of the concerned project.
					<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i><strong>Geotechnical engineers</strong> ensure that the foundations of the objects in consideration varying from buildings runways streets or dams are firm. The assess the responsiveness of the built structures such as tunnels, dams or buildings with the rocks or soil. They help in the planning and designing of the tunnels, slopes or the retaining walls.
					<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i><strong>Transportation engineers</strong> maintain, plan and design systems that includes streets and highways they also maintain and caters to day to day operations of bigger and complex projects such as airports ,seaports mass transit system and harbours.

					   <h3>Civil engineer salaries</h3>
					<p>The median annual wage for civil engineers is $83540. Median annual wage refers to the wage at which half of the workers earn more than the median amount and half earned less. The lowest 10% earned less than $53470, and the highest 10% earned more than $132880 given below are the median annual wages of civil engineers in the top industries in they work are as follows:</p>
					<ul class="list10">
								<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Federal government excluding postal service- $92320

					</ul>
					<p>Civil engineers have a rigorous job , working full time and 3in 10 tends to work more than 40 productive hours per week. Engineers who are in charge of the project may need to employ themselves for even more number of hours in order to keep a check on the progress of the work and to ensure that the work is being accomplished as per the plans framed in order to assure the best possible outcome.</p>

					<h3>Some of the major challenges that Civil Engineers Face while Making CDR </h3>
					<p class="cenb"><i>Understanding of the process thoroughly, can get one's CDR accepted by EA in the first attempt. To put this in a different way, the What's, How's and Why's of the whole process should be properly understood.</i></p>
					<p>They get little time i.e about three months to draft a CDR . They have to conduct a research and understand the particular requirements of EA to create and write the report. It is difficult for the engineers to complete the given task in the stipulated time period as it is lengthy and time consuming.</p>
					<ul class="list10">
					<li> <i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>The professionals who work to create the CDR are highly qualified engineers and excel in job of CDR Preparation as they have years of experience in the job , they can suggest skills to be highlighted in career episodes and to make sure that are in congruence to the requirements of the CDR summary .
					<p>They can help to identify the prime achievements of one's engineering career and to create the career episodes that are required by the EA assessors.</p>
					<li> <i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>The fear of rejection is faced by many visa applicants who ask for CDR assistance. It is natural to feel the fear as it is a once in a lifetime opportunity that requires an exceptional CDR to get an approval of EA. As there are hardly any second chances of getting the visa approved and one might have to give up their Australian dream.
