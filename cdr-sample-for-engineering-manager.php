                          <p>Generally, the CDR Report For Engineers consists of 3 CEs ( Career Episodes) that describe your professional engineering activities of last three projects, a summary statement providing crisp cross referencing to the competency elements discusses in your CE and a CPD (Continuing Professional Development) statement that lists short courses, workshops and training you have attended throughout your study career.</p>
                          <p>It is crucial for you to write these documents in a well defined proven format according to the competency standards setup by the Engineers Australia. Those candidates, who are unaware of these guidelines, often fail to make it to the migration list. We, at My CDR Help, can help you create an impressive and fully acceptable CDR within a few hours.
