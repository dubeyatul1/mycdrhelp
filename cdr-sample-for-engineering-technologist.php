			  <h3>Engineering Technologist CDR Report Help and EA Approved Samples (ANZSCO: 233914)</h3>
			  <p>Australia is one such place where migrant professionals get high pay salary and therefore Engineer's favourite working place and destination is Australia. Engineers must have to go through EA assessment process. For Australian immigration, you have to get a CDR report and submit to EA who is authorizing body for Professional Engineers Assessment process.</p>
			  <p>CDR reports are crucial to get a visa for Skilled Migration in Australia. It is important for the candidates to mention and highlight their competencies in each project or episodes. CDR samples are the best way to know about the format and give a fair idea. Students fail to understand the importance of this report and pose a risk for visa rejection. Engineers with a good record of accomplishment and excellent qualifications can also fail to get their visa because CDR reports are not written carefully that leads to CDR rejection by EA. Therefore, experts help them to understand the importance of CDR reports by providing samples.</p>
			  <p>All Engineering graduates Competency Demonstrations Report (CDR) those who have scored excellent marks in their semesters, IELTS, TOEFL and other English assessment tests should also have to write CDR according to Engineers Australia (EA)'s requirements which is a certified institution run by engineers. EA will examine English assessment test papers, certificates, competency reports and all the other connected documents thoroughly before approving them.</p>
			  <p> A CDR report is termed to be a vessel by virtue of which the engineers can get hold of their VISA regarding skilled migrations within Australia. Through such, the engineers can provide a proof regarding their competencies. EA that is Engineers Australia, being the authority for undertaking assessment regarding applications for skilled immigration, provides help on the preparation of CDR report. </p>

					   <h3>Importance of CDR Report for Engineers to Migrate Australia</h3>
			<p>CDR report is a priceless and important technical report which provides comprehensive information about personal, education, engineering aptitude levels and different projects handled by the students in college or company. Millions of engineers are showing interest to get engineering job in the other than home country like Australia, New Zealand, UK and Canada which offer engineering job on high salary to international migrant engineer. Responsible approval body/agency is capable to admit skilled and competent students based on the competency demonstration report submitted. Engineers Australia is team of senior engineers who have expansive knowledge in the engineering domain. They are responsible for approving the assessment competency report after they satisfied with the technical competency levels.</p>
			<p>In Australia, good engineers are in great demand. The industrial growth has bestowed due to surge in economic growth and increase of state of technology.  The Australian government has been executing plans to encourage migration to Australia - especially for those who fall under the skilled migrant category, like engineers. As engineering is a technical subject, the engineers are assessed on certain param

						  <p><b>1.	Carrier episode:</b> A career Episode (CE) describes different zones experiences of your life that you have faced in an institute and in a company. It describes a position or an engineering project in which you have participated. The description should focus on the 16 competency elements found in the summary statement.</p>
						  <p><b>2.	Summary Statement:</b> Although a Summary Statement is brief document but it is the most difficult and most important segment of your CDR report. In that one page, you have to show all your potential regarding engineering and management skills by drawing episodes from the Career Episodes (CEs) you have written earlier. The cross-referencing of paragraphs from CEs must highlights competencies that you possess.</p>
						  <p><b>3.	CPD:</b> A CPD Report is required by Engineers Australia for Migration Skilled Assessment. This report showcase that an engineer is keeping himself up-to-date with latest developments in field of engineering. CPD is a document of skills, knowledge and experience that you gained both formally and informally beyond initial training. All related skills must be included in Competency Demonstration Report (CDR) application. <br/><b>This Continuing Professional Development (CPD) must be in list format with following essential information:</b></p>

Therefore, it is necessary to choose words, spelling and writing style so that your draft fits into the Australian standards.</p>
