                                  <p>Within the career episode in first stage, the description has been given by the author regarding the project done by him regarding the fulfilment of needs in partial regarding the master degree of science. The name of the project was “Hydraulic Conductivity, Infiltration, and Runoff from No-till and Tilled Cropland”. There were a few responsibilities for the author. The author was to make quantifications regarding the satiated conductivity of hydraulics along with the irrigations of centre pivot for non till systems on longer terms, through runoffs. He was also to determine the slot effect along with the effect of disk planting and ridges on the satiated conductivity of hydraulics. It was to be considered inside a furrowed field irrigated along with measuring the satiated conductivity of hydraulics over drylands that are tilled and plots with no tilling. He was also to undertake investigations regarding the factors which might be responsible for the increment of satiated conductivity of hydraulics and reducing the runoff. Further, he was to study the pivot center regarding the irrigated field of both tilled and not tilled for the determination of the no-till effect of planting over runoff and filtration. He was also to investigate the four function models of pedotransfers. The models were Factor of crust, ROSETTA, equations regarding the prediction project of water erosion (WEPP) and the tools of Water Soil Characteristics in order to describe the satiated conductivity of hydraulics.</p>

There were a few responsibilities for the author regarding the project. He had to describe the ROOT issues along with their solutions. Further, he had to provide dual benchmarks that were developed for the ROOT. Then he had to make proposals regarding frameworks of novel algorithm in order to solve ROOT. Further, he was responsible for demonstrating the advantages regarding framework proposed through the comparison of TMO approach representatives. It was to be done via an instantiation regarding the framework proposed. Finally, he had to put the dynamic strategy of handling into use.</p>

                                  <p>In the third Career episode, the author had prepared this thesis for the Ph.D. program. The project had been named as the "Environment-Friendly Pultrusion". In the process of preparation of the project, the writer was assigned with a task of developing a Pultrusion technique that should be needed to be environmentally friendly and used for the production of composites that were fibre-reinforced. Firstly, the thesis consisted of an analysis of the mechanical and physical properties of the composites that were acquired by the pultrusion technique. Further, an analysis of the thermo-mechanical properties of the composites that had been pultruded has also been analysed. In the next step of the thesis, the writer had designed and evaluated the lateral spreading that the roving’s would generate. It shall be evaluated by a rig and it shall be used for the analysis of the lateral spreading. The writer, in the next part of the thesis, had provided a design of a proper pultrusion technique so that the impregnators of the resins are processed in a clean pultrusion. It has further been seen that the writer had also evaluated the clean pultrusion method for resin impregnation. Further, a clean pultrusion method or technology has been demonstrated as per the industrial standards. Lastly, the writer had provided a comparison of the condition of the clean pultrusion acquired composites and further implement an LCA on such a pultrusion process that is clean as well as conventional.</p>

Both Engineers and non-Engineers have to appear in the following tests so that they are acknowledged by the Department of immigration and border protection which is often abbreviated as DIBP. There is a three years of maximum time limit for the acceptance of the test previous to submitting for migration skill assessment.</p>

TOEFL has two types of examinations. The first is the internet based test which is known as TOEFL-IBT and the other one is the paper based offline exam known as TOEFL-PBT. These tests evaluate proficiency of a person in four sections, which is reading, speaking, listening and writing. 30 marks are allotted for each and every section. All the evaluations are done to convince the authorities about academic proficiency with the language itself. It will take four hours to completely go through the test. Someone can get a Skilled Visa with at least a score of 24 for reading and listening section while the score for writing is 27 and the score for speaking is 23.</p>
