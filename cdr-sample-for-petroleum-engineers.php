                       <br/>					  
					   <p>Australia is one of the most developed countries and is widely preferred among engineering professionals for the enormous diversity, growth, infrastructure, elegance, and lifestyle it offers. Recently it has also been voted as the happiest nation in the world, which gives professionals another reason to migrate to this socially and economically developed country. There is no better country than Australia to build a career for Petroleum engineers credits for which goes to the growing economy and infrastructure. So if you desire to work as an engineer in Australia, you need to go through a migration skills assessment by Engineers Australia. You will also require submitting a top-notch quality CDR report for Petroleum Engineer (233512).</p>
					   <h3>What makes a Good and EA acceptable CDR Report?</h3>
					   <p>Here are a few characteristics that make a good CDR Report:</p>
					   <ul class="list10">
					   <li> <i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>When it comes to the CDR report, the Career Episodes must mention your skills as a Professional Engineer, Engineering Manager, Engineer Associate, and Engineering Technologist with utmost perfection. Hence you must pick your career episodes wisely so that it makes your CDR report stand out and prove your competency for the engineering category you are applying in.</li>
					   <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Remember, the EA assessor analyses your communication skills through the report. So avoid any grammatical, syntax, or punctuation errors and use proper Australian English.</li>
					   <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Be precise with the information you write in your CDR report. Engineers Australia has no interest in the history of your work or your achievements. What they look for is to know more about your role as an engineer in the company and your contributions to the project you undertook.</li>
					   <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>You must be prepared to verify the claims you make in the report in the form of evidence and documents. </li>
					   <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>EA prefers a prescriptive writing style for Career Episodes. These episodes should be written in the first person - in an active voice. It means that you should use words as <i>I researched, I planned, I handled,etc.</i></li>
					   <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>As per Engineers Australia, one crucial part of the CDR report is a Summary Statement, which must be relevant to the career episodes you write in your report. Make sure all the aspects of your CDR report is related to the competency elements required for the Skilled Migration Category.</li>
					   </ul>
					   <p>Also, another crucial factor you must keep in mind while writing your CDR report is to mention the technical problems you faced while working on the project, explain if not handled well by you, how it could have incurred huge losses to your company. Write about your role in solving the problem as an engineer and the awards or recognition you received for putting in the efforts.</p>
					   <p class="cenb"><i>It is crucial for you to write CDR Report in a well defined proven format according to the competency standards setup by the Engineers Australia. Those candidates, who are unaware of these guidelines, often fail to make it to the migration list. We, at My CDR Help, can help you to create an impressive and fully acceptable CDR within a few days.</i></p>
					   
						<h3>Find out here how to write the best career episodes for your CDR report:</h3>
						<p>Engineers Australia requires you to write three career episodes in your CDR report for petroleum engineers. Since EA will analyse it to understand your competency and skills, you must write them with utmost precision and make sure you pick the best three career episodes from your career which can highlight your skills, leadership qualities, and expertise in the field. You can also refer to our CDR report sample available for a petroleum engineer to understand the format or to eliminate any confusion.</p>
						<p class="cenb"><i>We have committed Native Engineering experts for all Engineering subjects who have already qualified EA assessment in the first attempt.</i></p>
						<h3>How to Write the Three Career Episodes as per MSA?</h3>
						<p class="cenb">Career Episode composition is a critical part of your Competency Demonstration Report (CDR) – required by Engineers Australia (EA) to pass judgment on whether your Engineering aptitudes and information coordinate the Australian principles or not.</p>
						<p>A career episode proves your competency and demonstrates your work experience and your engineering abilities. Each career episode you pick must be focused on a specific period and highlight your abilities and skills in engineering activity. The episode you pick must demonstrate how you used your skills, expertise, and engineering knowledge in the nominated occupation.</p>
						<p> You may pick a career episode based on:</p>
						<ul class="list10">
						<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>an engineering task was undertaken by you during your educational program;</li>
						<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>a project you are currently working on related to petroleum engineering or have worked on.</li>
						<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>any particular position that you are currently on or occupied in the past, but it should just comprise a mere duty statement</li>
						<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>an engineering-related problem you solved</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Make sure that you write your career episode in proper English and do not copy and paste content from CDR reports sample available online. It will also prove your communication skills abilities to the assessor.</p>
						<p>Just keep the narrative short and remember that EA is not interested in your work history. They just need you to mention your best three career episodes. The narrative must be 1000 to 2500 words.</p>
						<p>Each career episode should speak about your engineering skills and abilities and how you applied them for achieving the desired outcomes. Explain what you did, how you achieved the results. Do not use too many technical details. Write in active voice and first-person (for example- I resolved, I handled).</p>
						<p>The career episode you pick must highlight any engineering-related problem handled by you and the techniques you used to solve it. It will help assessors to acknowledge your contribution in executing project and task objectives.</p>
						<ul class="list10">
						<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Technical problems and difficulties identified by you and your approach to resolving it</li>
						<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Any strategy or creative design work by you to solve the issue </li>
						<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>How you coordinated and teamed up with other team members</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Number each paragraph you write in your career episode. This helps you refer to the paragraphs while writing the summary statement. The following system is recommended:</p>
						<p>Career episode 1 (paragraphs 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 etc.)</p>
						<p>Career episode 2 (paragraphs 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 etc.)</p>
						<p>Career episode 3 (paragraphs 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 etc.)</p>
						<p>Please Note: Career episode plays a crucial role in your CDR report. So use it wisely and explain your role and the inputs you gave in resolving the technical issues you faced.</p>

					    <h3>Top 10 Expert Advices to Write a Perfect CDR Report for Engineers Australia</h3>	
						<p class="cenb"><i>Understanding of the process thoroughly, can get one’s CDR accepted by EA in the first attempt. To put this in a different way, the What’s, How’s and Why’s of the whole process should be properly understood</i></p>
						<p>It is an undeniable fact that writing a Competency Demonstration Report for Skilled Migration Visa to Australia requires expertise; hence you must not miss any technicalities or guidelines stated by Engineers Australia (EA). Remember, even a minute mistake can lead your CDR report to rejection. So make sure you provide EA with an authentic and uniquely written CDR report. Also, you must avoid misrepresentation of any information at any cost. Do not use bits and pieces of any CDR Report sample available online as even slight plagiarism can make EA reject your CDR report right away. To avoid any chances of rejection, you can always consider taking the help of CDR plagiarism checking and removal services available.</p>
						<p>Here are the top 10 bits of advice explained by our best CDR writing experts that will surely help you get an Australian Visa without any hassle:</p>
						<p>1. Be very precise and clear while mentioning the project in your career episode, and don’t forget to write the details about the company or organization you have worked with. It must include:</p>
						<ul class="list10">
						<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Project Objectives</li>
						<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Details about the Company & location</li>
						<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Company’s background </li>
						<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Your Career Stage (Mention if you were studying at the time, or if it was the first job, or if you were working at a middle-management position at the time of the Career Episode you chose to write about) </li>
						<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Mention details like how long was the project or the duration of it.</li>
						<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> was your position in the Project Hierarchy? </li>
						</ul>
						<p>2. Go through the ANZSCO Code of the engineering discipline you choose. Read about it in detail and make sure you cover all the aspects and the responsibilities it mentions.</p>
						<p>Include at least five to six of the tasks and don’t forget to refer to them when you write the summary statement.</p>
						<p>Read all the instructions and guidelines stated by Engineers Australia carefully and do not miss to number the paragraphs you write for Career Episodes. It will help you refer to the Career Episodes with ease while writing the Summary Statement. Don’t forget to use the active voice in Career Episodes and write in the first person.</p>
						<p>3. Keep the purpose of writing the CDR report very clear in mind. All that EA is looking for is to analyze how you handled the technical challenges you faced during your work tenure and your competency in the selected engineering field. The challenges you mention must be relevant to the engineering discipline tasks as mentioned in the ANZSCO codes.</p>
						<p>4. Focus more on areas that carry high weightage in the skill assessment. Mention any two most important designs you have worked on and then explain all the details related to them.</p>
						<p>5. Maintain track of all the technical calculations you did during the project. What were the results and write about your approach towards the problem and how you solved it? Explain in detail and refer to them while working on the Summary Statement.</p>
						<p>6. Write about the Standards or Codes you used, training that you have attended or the tools or software you used. It brings authenticity to your report and proves your credibility as an engineer.</p>
						<p>7. For the CPD list, you can list the presentations, workshops, or seminars you attended. It is always wise to showcase the literature review or the documentation as well or presentations, if any, given by you to the clients or any other stakeholders associated with the project. It will help in explaining how committed and dedicated you were to your profession.</p>
						<p>8. EA looks for many positive personality traits in a potential Visa 189 candidate that include how you dealt with the team members or how you valued your team participation and their role, and most importantly your capability to lead the team. If you can prove how you helped your company to prevent losses by coming up with the right solutions, EA will surely award you some additional points.</p>
						<p>9. Other than the technical difficulties, it would be great if you can write about how you handled health, environmental, or safety-related regulations and policies in any of your career episodes. Any social activity organized or participated by you to comply with the environment or similar activities can be mentioned here.</p>
						<p>10. Last but not least, you must not miss writing about your professional achievements after writing the Career Episodes. You can mention the project outcomes, recognition, or awards for your contribution, or targets achieved.</p>

                                  <p>When you embark upon a new journey, you are prepared to pass all the hurdles and take in all the good things. Similarly, when you apply for skilled migration visa to Australia, you should be well prepared with your engineering skills and knowledge to cross any hurdle that comes your way. You should be able to meet the requirements and have enough educational and professional exposure desired by the Engineers Australia (EA).</p> 
                                  
                                  <p>Once you get the desired CDR, it will provide you the gate pass to your dream destination. CDR (Competency Development Report) showcases your technical abilities which you have acquired through the engineering experiences, and EA is the assessing authority who tries to assess your skills and knowledge.</p>
                                  
                                  <p>The EA Migration Skills Assessment Booklet provides a complete picture of what is desired by the EA with all the guidelines laid down very carefully. On top of that, even if you do not understand the booklet, there are online services who provide CDR help and can review the requirements of CDR for you.</p>
                                  
                                  <p>When a Petroleum Engineer wishes to apply for a skilled migration visa to Australia, it is imperative for him to fulfill the competency indicators, as required by the EA. If you think that CDR is just a short report on your professional achievements, you must be mistaken. A CDR has three important sections to it.</p>

                                 <p>This section is where you have to describe three independent career episodes and must be completed in the word limit of 1000-2500 words as laid down in the guidelines of the EA. Each project should clearly describe your technical skills, leadership abilities, and work ethics. Writing three different career episodes enables you to project your skills efficiently and enhances the competencies that you can cover. You must be able to reflect your competencies confidently and choose. Provide the episodes for which you have proof of evidence and raw results which you can show in case you are asked for it.</p> 
                                 <p>Make sure that the episodes are written in the first person and should focus only on your own contributions. You should more often use terms such as “I did this,” “I led the team,” “and my role was to.” The EA team is more interested to know of the tasks which you carried out yourself rather than the team in which you were working. They want to know more about your depth of knowledge, initiative, goals achieved, understanding of the changing environment, technical abilities, ability to handle problems, etc. The CDR reports it should be prepared in high-quality English with no grammatical errors, and it should be plagiarism free. Preferably they must be written in Australian English which should not be confused with British English.The CDR should also be linked to the summary statement, and each paragraph should be marked properly.</p>

                                 <p>This is the shortest of all the three sections but is the most important. It links all the paragraphs of CDR with the summary so that the assessors can go through your summary and refer back to the CDR easily. You get to guide the assessor to the particular paragraph that showcases a certain competency indicator required for the concerned ANZSCO code. You should make sure that all the paragraphs should be properly numbered and linked so that it allows for easy referencing. This shows your ability to analyze and pay attention to detail. All these things are taken under observation and is essential for your selection.</p> 
                                 <p>Engineers find it difficult to meet all the criteria of CDR and they might miss out on something. You can connect with online service providers who provide CDR help and get your CDR report written by providing them your details. It would ensure you a chance of selection in the first chance and provide an opportunity for a better life.</p>
