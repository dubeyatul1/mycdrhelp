                                  <h2>Cambridge Test of English: </h2>
                                  <p>The Cambridge test of English is an eminent evaluation system for the language proficiency. Four sections are here to assess the skills, which are reading and use of English, writing, listening and speaking. The score is given out of 210 and to get a skilled visa one has to appear in the advance level of the Cambridge test and with at least a score of 185.</p>
                                  <p>At the end, the Competency Demonstration Report contains all the credentials of the applicant, such as the educational qualification, the English proficiency test skill certificates issued by any one of the above mentioned tests. The credentials mentioned here must match with all the agencies records because if they don’t match anyhow, the processing of the application and the progress of the visa processing will be hindered and elongated.</p>
