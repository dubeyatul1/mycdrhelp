                        <h3>Competency Demonstration Report for Telecommunication Engineer</h3>
                        <p>It is always very much important for the Telecommunications Field Engineer to write an impressive Competency Demonstration Report (CDR) report to crack the ENGINEERS AUSTRALIA (EA, Assessing body for engineering related professions) hurdle. Since the telecommunication is a very crucial industry, Australia allows only highly competent telecommunication engineers to stay and work there.</p>
                        <p>Thus, you always need to write very functional and impressive career episodes to make a positive impression on the assessors. Therefore, you can get a skilled migration visa very quickly to fulfil your dream of settling and working in Australia. CDR is a documented statement that is an essential requirement by the EA for the assessment of different occupations under engineering. EA is an organization that plays a main role in employing and assessing an engineer from his qualification and description. The competency of a candidate is determined and evaluated by EA from the report submitted by him. So it is important to provide an advanced and plagiarism free telecommunication filed engineer CDR Report. An improper and ineffective competency report may reduce the chances of your migration to Australia. The career episode report is the medium through which an aspirant engineer showcases his knowledge and highlights his overall proficiencies. Summary statement report helps in transition of your current resume to the type of position you seek. This will highlight all of your career progress in short and compulsory for an engineer to obtain a particular immigration visa to Australia without any problems and build an engineering career in Australia.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Australia Pathways and Designation</h3>
                        <p>EA directly recognizes an engineer with engineering qualifications from countries such as UK, USA, and Canada. Engineering qualification from these countries is covered under Washington accord and doesnâ€™t require a competency report. Engineers with engineering qualifications from countries such as India, Pakistan, Qatar, UAE, Saudi, Bahrain, Oman, etc. are required to submit a demonstration report and are given recognition from their career episode report. Engineering qualifications from these countries are not covered under the Washington accord and are required to submit a summary statement report.</p>

This is the reason why the career episode part is given more importance. It should be written with good Australian English as it depicts your communication skills. Summary Statement is the section that concludes and depicts your overall view of each of the career episode. An effective CDR of telecommunication field engineers assists the EA in evaluating and assessing the competency of an engineer.</p>
