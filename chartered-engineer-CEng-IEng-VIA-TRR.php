				<p>After being accepted as a MCIBSE, you can decide whether to register in Chartered Engineering with the Engineering council (UK) or not. The candidate will be offered to prepare a technical report if they do not have any necessary qualifications. The technical report is different from the Engineering practice report which have to submitted along for the CIBSE membership. The submission is mainly implemented after the applications related to the process of the MCIBSE have been approved. </p>
				<h3>Purpose of the Technical report </h3>
				<p>The main purpose related to the preparation of the technical report is to depict that the candidate have obtained same knowledge regarding engineering as a person with proper qualification and degree. The registration in the CEng level will require proper knowledge and understand of the MEng level which is master degree of Engineering. The technical report of the candidate should require aspects related to the engineering of building services.</p>
				<p>The candidate must identify the problems arising technically and demonstrate how the problems can be solved through engineering knowledge.</p>
				<p><b>The report should be prepared on the basis of the following -</b></p>
				<ul class="list10">
				 <li class=""><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Description of the project in which the candidate have taken part in.</li>
				 <li class=""><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Investigating related to the project associated with building services should be undertaken.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The purpose related to the report shows that the knowledge obtained by the candidates if there is any lack of formal qualifications related to education. However the technical report should not include competence relevant to their profession like the management experiences and skills. The ideal qualification for registering is MEng and CEng or any other honours degree with proper knowledge of the Master's level.</p>
