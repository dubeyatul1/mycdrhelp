            <h3>About CIBSE CEng </h4>
            <p>The organization Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE) is an association sustaining in the UK region. This association represents the mechanical, electrical and architectural engineers. In other words, this association is comprised of building services engineers. This association is a member of the Construction Industry Council. Engineering Council has licensed this association to include applicants on its Register of Professional Engineers.</p>
            <h3>Professional Registration </h4>
            <p>CIBSE is an institution licensed by the Engineering Council. This entitles the applicants registered with this association to gain viable benefits. These benefits involve the applicants to be registered for Engineering Technician (EngTech), Incorporated Engineer (IEng) and Chartered Engineer (CEng). However, the applicants will be able to relish these benefits after acquiring adequate professional skill and reaching the appropriate qualification level.</p>

			<h3>CIBSE Membership</h3>
      <h4 style="font-size:18px;">Technical Report Route (TRR) to IEng Registration – A23</h4>
			<p>After you are accepted as an ACIBSE, you might seek Incorporated Engineer (IEng) registration with the Engineering Council of UK. However, if you do not meet the requirements set by the council, you would have to write a technical report. This report should be separate from that of the Engineering Practice Report which is also required for CIBSE membership. This should be submitted after gaining approval for ACIBSE. The exemplifying qualifications for IEng is an accredited Bachelor's Degree or it may be BTEC HNC/D  with other associated further learning qualifications. </p>
      <h4 style="font-size:18px;">Significance of the Technical Report</h4>
			<p>Purpose of this technical report is to prove your competence and show that you have the same level of competency as that of a person with exemplifying qualifications. For registration at IEng level, you need to show that have knowledge equivalent knowledge to that of BEng (Hons)- Bachelor of Engineering. Your technical report should be much like your portrayal of decision making and problem solving that appear to be building characteristics of engineering fundamentals. Your report should normally be based on your project and what you have done during the project. This should also be able to mention your contribution towards the projects and how you have been able to handle the situation. It must be kept in mind that the report should be able to compensate for the lack of academic qualifications. However, this report should not be about your skills and knowledge as that would be covered by the Engineering Practice Report (see fact sheets A20 and A21). </p>
      <h4 style="font-size:18px;">The application procedure</h4>
			<p>During the registration process you will need to provide contact details of your mentor and a brief or synopsis of what you will include in the technical report. Other information that would be asked are mentioned below: </p>
      <h4 style="font-size:18px;">Mentor support: </h4>
			<p>In the planning process, CIBSE strongly recommends the help of a Mentor, who should be a holder of IEng or CEng registration with the ECUK. They can be colleagues at work, a teacher or trainer, who has immense knowledge about the building blocks of Engineering and is a building services Engineer. Moreover, you should choose a mentor that you can trust and is willing to help you out. Make sure to go through the requirements of ECUK Registration as it will guide you to take a proper approach with the technical report. </p>
			<h4 style="font-size:18px;">Synopsis: </h4>
			<p>As mentioned earlier, there is a need to submit a synopsis of your technical report to the CIBSE for gaining approval. Follow the Synopsis Guidance Sheet before writing the synopsis, which is given at the end of the synopsis form. Response to each of the Four sections should not be more than 250 words. CIBSE would respond to the synopsis form within 8-10 weeks stating you to proceed as per guidelines or they may reject the application and will mention to amend it. </p>
			<p><b>NB:</b> submit the form and the documents via email and by post as supporting documentation.</p>
      <h4 style="font-size:18px;">The technical report: </h4>
			<p><b>Content:</b> The completed report should include a written explanation of the diagrams and calculations. This will help to show your understanding of the fundamentals. Some of the important areas to show your competency are mathematical aspects and calculations, use of proper software for solving problems, application of analysis and modeling, use of sustainable technologies. Apart from these, scientific knowledge of materials and properties of them, application of knowledge from technical resources and methods, application of engineering processes like designing and implying any development also stands empirical. </p>
			<p><b>NB:</b> make sure to include your own thoughts and works for the technical report. If you are doing calculations, make sure to put them in the appendices and not in the main body of the report. </p>
			<p><b>Structure:</b> The report should be framed in English with introduction, aim, discussion and evaluation. The report should be written on your own and it should not be framed on the base of other reports unless and until that information is used in the appendices. The below structure should be maintained.</p>
		  <h4 style="font-size:18px;">Title</h4>
		  <h4 style="font-size:18px;">Introduction</h4><p> Introduction to the report and what it is about</p>
