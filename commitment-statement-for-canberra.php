                <h3>Commitment Statement for Canberra<br/>D* C*</h3>
				<p class="para">My wife and I started thinking seriously about emigrating to Australia following an extended holiday to the East Coast in July/August 2010. We decided to engage emigration consultants, ‘The Emigration Group’ to help us decide on a suitable location and, following an extensive interview and several lengthy telephone conversations with them, plus a chat with the representative from ACT at the London Expo on 14th September 2010 who gave us some useful literature to read, we decided that ACT was the place for us.</p>
                <h4 class="kao">Why Canberra?</h4>
                <p class="para">Our research suggests that Canberra offers a lot of similarities to our home life, while adding all the elements that drive us to try to emigrate to Australia. We live in a village on the outskirts of a market town in Wiltshire, a beautiful part of the UK, where we are very happy. Canberra has several similarities:</p>
                <ul class="list10">
                 <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Getting around Wiltshire is relatively easy due to the quieter roads, low pollution, and fewer traffic jams found in this part of the country. All major cities in Wiltshire can be reached in 45minutes or less. Getting around Canberra is reported to be easy, convenient, and quick with journey times averaging about 20 minutes (www.liveincanberra.com.au). </li>
                 <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>We have lots of beautiful open countryside around our home town, including Salisbury Plain, The Cotswold Hills, and Savernake Forest where we can explore wildlife and natural environments on our doorstep. Canberra’s design offers a contrast of nature and urban areas, giving great access to wide-open spaces, lakes, the Australian National Botanical gardens, ponds and reserves, and the easily accessible bush. Even the coast is only about two hours away.</li>
                 <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>My wife and I love to walk and cycle to explore the countryside. We have lots of wonderful footpaths and bridleways in Wiltshire including the Wiltshire Cycleway. Canberra has an extensive network of cycleways and walkways that offer enjoyable and safe routes around the parks and lakes (www.tams.act.gov.au) of the city.</li>
                 <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>House prices in our part of the UK are not cheap as we live in a very desirable part of the UK, but average incomes are higher than the national average. This is similar to Canberra where houses are not the cheapest in Australia, but incomes are higher, and Canberra offers the best home loan affordability in Australia.</li>
                 <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>The population of Wiltshire is about 650,000 and the continued development of new homes across the county intends to bring greater employment opportunities in the building and supporting industries. Canberra is also a growing city, with population growth from 350,000 up to 500,000 by 2020. This affords the same opportunities as Wiltshire for employment in the relevant sectors.</li>
                 <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Wiltshire folk have often been born and bred in the county, and people who come to settle here rarely leave. This is because once you have lived here you fall in love with the place and have no desire to leave. Canberra is similar because people who live there tend to love the place. We have spoken to Australians who tell us how beautiful it is and how it is often underestimated by Australians who don’t know it.</li>
                </ul>
				
				<p>There are many things we love about where we live today and we have tried to show why we believe that Canberra is so attractive to us. Canberra also offers many things that we cannot get in the UK and I will endeavor to cover these later.</p>

					<h4 class="kao">Research</h4>
                    <p class="para">We have used the internet as the basis for our research but we have tried to balance it out with other sources:</p>
                    <ul class="list10">
				   <li>1. Expo – Australia House – September 2010. I spoke to one of the representatives on the Canberra Stand who extended my knowledge of the city by informing me about the excellent standard of living, the well-planned layout of this modern city, and the attractive career opportunities for me.</li>
				   <li>2. Talking to Australian contacts who have family living and owning property in ACT, We have learned that Canberra is often dismissed by Australians as being boring, cold, and full of politicians, but it is actually a very clean, safe, and relaxed place to live, with everything you would expect from a world-class capital, yet the bush, Sydney, snowfields and south coast beaches are all within easy reach.</li>
				   <li>3. The Canberra Times – This has proved invaluable in providing information on jobs, property, and news, as well as useful advertisements for cars, local issues, and leisure information.</li>
				   <li>4. Live In Canberra – We have used the website and the information pack as useful reference material to enable us to ask more specific questions as we get closer to our potential move to Canberra.</li>
                   </ul>
                    <p class="para">We have also used other resources which will become apparent further in this statement.</p>

                 <h4 class="kao">Compelling Reasons for choosing Canberra</h4>
                 <p>As well as the items covered in our comparison with Wiltshire there are a number of other compelling reasons for choosing Canberra:</p>
                 <p><b>1. Employment –</b></p>
                 <p class="para">Da**** – I have worked in Quantity Surveying for over twenty years and can bring a wealth of experience to a future employer, as recognized through my skills assessment of 2122-11 Quantity Surveying by the AICS.  The Canberra Construction Snapshot newsletter, released by the Chief Ministers Department keeps me informed of planned capital works and construction activities in Canberra and suggests a buoyant industry with a vibrant and diverse construction sector in the ACT.  </p>
                 <p class="para"> We have repeatedly used the Canberra Times, www.seek.com.au, www.careerone.com.au, www.simplyhired.com.au, and www.indeed.com.au  to research the local job markets and have repeatedly seen jobs that fit my skill set and career history. Canberra’s salaries are higher than the national average and I was pleased to see that wages were slightly higher than my existing salary within the UK. I am confident that I will be able to gain employment within Canberra.</p>
                 <p class="para">De**** – now works from home as a private tutor, running a small tutoring agency, and teaching in local primary schools as a cover teacher. She will be hoping to find work on relocation to Canberra and has a number of skills to offer. She is a fully qualified and experienced primary school teacher and a qualified medical laboratory scientist. She also has an honors degree in environmental science and IT. Given the low unemployment rate in Canberra of circa 3%, we see no problems in Denise gaining employment to suit her skills and experience.</p>
                 <p><b>2. Lifestyle and Worklife Balance –  </b></p>
                 <p class="para">It is in this area that we feel there is the most to be gained by relocating to Canberra. Although there are many things we like within our home county of Wiltshire which compare favorably with Canberra; Canberra also offers us significant benefits over the UK:</p>
                 <ul class="wewre">
									<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i><b>Climate – </b>It is much warmer than the UK and our research shows that it has more sunshine than Sydney and Melbourne and certainly more than the UK. However, there are four distinct seasons: fresh winters, balmy autumns, breathtaking springs, and warm to hot summers. We both enjoy the variety that seasonal weather offers and a brisk walk on a crisp morning is as enjoyable as a warm stroll on a summer’s evening. Canberra will offer us all this.</li>
									<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i><b>Work-life balance – </b>Da**** has spent a number of years commuting long distances up to an hour’s drive from home, meaning an average daily commute of about two hours. This can often be longer due to poor road conditions, general congestion, traffic incidents, and roadworks. Given that Canberra is an ACT cluster and average commutes are 15 – 20 minutes, this offers a significant improvement in work-life balance.</li>
									<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i><b>Arts, Culture, Sports and Leisure Facilities – </b>We enjoy attending the theatre and cinema, listening to music events and watching sport. Canberra has much to offer with many cultural and leisure venues including the National Museum of Australia, the National Zoo, Lake Burley Griffin and the National Gallery, There are opportunities to watch the Brumbies, motorsport and other major events including Floriade and the Balloon Fiesta. There is also the bush on the doorstep, skiing to the west and the coast to the east. Not to mention the cosmopolitan nature of the city itself. We believe it to be the perfect environment to live in.</li>							
				 </ul>
                 <p><b>3. Property –</b></p>
                 <p class="para">We have used www.realestate.com.au, www.domain.com.au, and www.allhomes.com.au, as well as the Canberra Times, to research the Canberra property market and have identified some regions where we would choose to live. We would prefer a more established area such as Farrer, Belconnen, Macquarie, Bruce, South Woden, or Aranda. Although these areas are more expensive than the newer, less established areas, we feel we can find a good quality, well-sized 3 or 4 bedrooms home with a good plot for around $***K - $***K. We believe we will have a deposit of $***K which will leave us with a mortgage of $***K – ***K.	</p>
                 <p class="para">In the early stages of our migration, we plan to rent a property which we understand maybe more of a challenge as there are fewer rental properties available than we expected.</p>
                 <p><b>4. Summary –</b></p>
                 <p class="para">To summarise, we believe Canberra offers us compelling reasons to consider as the place to live within Australia. It is a wonderfully cosmopolitan city with great amenities, good job opportunities and is easy to get around. It has the perfect climate, beautiful scenery in and around the city, and friendly people who have a positive frame of mind. The future development of Canberra offers great long-term opportunities and we really hope for a positive response to our state sponsorship application so that we can begin to live our dream.</p>
