                  <h3>Commitment Statement Tasmania</h3>
          
                  <p>If you are a skilled worker and wish to live and work in Tasmania, the Skilled Nominated visa (Subclass 190), which is a permanent residence visa is a must.</p>
                  
                  <p>You can earn five additional points on getting a State nomination from Tasmania for the above-mentioned visa. These additional points can help you reach closer to the 65 points that are the test pass marks as set by the Department of Home Affairs. You can get more information on this under the ‘Eligibility’ section.</p>
                  
                  <p>It is important to mention here that if you are nominated for this visa by the Tasmanian Government, then you will have to live in Tasmania for two consecutive years post the granting of the visa.</p>
				  <p>For the skilled workers to live and work in Tasmania, a Skilled Visa Nomination is mandatory. And after getting nominated, the candidate must live in Tasmania for two years. The normal processing time of this visa may range between two to eight weeks. There can be a delay in the processing time of the visa due to many reasons like an increase in the number of applications, seasonal peaks, and demanding cases. Age, occupation, and proficiency in the English language are the deciding factors in assessing the eligibility of skilled workers for skilled migration</p>
				  <p>The first and foremost objective while writing the commitment statement Tasmania is that it should not exceed two pages in length and should be original and fact-based. The statement should include details about the lifestyle of Tasmania and must sight the main reason behind the candidate’s decision to migrate to Tasmania. In no way should any content be copied from other sources to avoid plagiarism.</p>

                    <h3>How to apply for Skilled Nominated Visa</h3>
                    <p>As a potential candidate, you need to realize that application for state nomination and application for the visa are two separate processes. It is the Tasmanian Government that assesses applications for state nomination, while the Department of Home Affairs assesses visa applications.</p>
					<p>How thorough are you with the requirements and how well you prepare the application can have a great impact on the processing time? The more thorough you are with the requirements and do as prescribed can play a big role in getting the process done easily. Thus, it is logical to be ready with all the necessary documents before starting filling up the application to avoid any unnecessary delay. The processing time is affected by the overall quality and thoroughness of your application. It is recommended that you keep all the necessary documentation ready with you before starting the process of applying to help avoid delays. Other factors that impact processing times include changes in application volumes, seasonal peaks, and demanding cases.</p>
					<p>The Tasmanian Government does not have the permission to provide specific migration advice concerning visa options. Such advice can be given only by registered migration agents or lawyers.</p>

                             <p> There is a difference between an Expression of Interest (EOI) and a visa application and the two are not to be confused. EOI acts as an indication to the Government of Tasmania. It expresses your willingness to be considered for a skilled visa.</p>
							 <p>The entire process of EOI is managed by the Department of Home Affairs through SkillSelect. So, you have to lodge a proper EOI through the SkillSelect, and then only your application will be considered. SkillSelect is a tool by which the Department of Home Affairs manages the entire visa application process by evaluating EOI. It is only those who receive a proper invitation to SkillSelect that can carry on with the visa application process.</p>
							 <p>Once you are done with this process of lodging an EOI via SkillSelect, you can apply for a Tasmanian Government state nomination.</p>
							 <h3>List of Documents – Understand the Requirement</h3>
							 <p>Please note that you must read and understand the nomination requirements carefully before preparing the listed documents below:-</p>
							 <ul class="list10">
							 <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>All the listed documents must be uploaded while conducting the online application process and before an application is given the status of being lodged.</li>
							 <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Migration Tasmania may also seek additional documents if required from you and can also directly contact the references that you have listed in the application to verify all such details in terms of educations qualification and experience that you are furnished.</li>
							 <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>It is important that whatever information and details you provide are updated and genuine. Any kind of false or fake information can lead to the rejection of the application and may even be subjected to further investigation by agencies like the Department of Home Affairs. </li>
							 <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>To keep the process of making the application simple and uncomplicated, you should sort all the similar types of documents and turn them into a single PDF instead of uploading each separately. For example, you can make one PDF file of all the bank-related documents, one for rental agreements and one for payslips, and so on. </li>
							 <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>You can refer to this Home Affairs page for occupations of people for any documents that need to be 'signed and witnessed'</li>

					  <h3>Apply for nomination</h3>
					  <p>You must take every care while arranging for the supporting documents to make sure that no important document is missed. It is on the successful submission of supporting documents on which the assessment of an application for state nomination is based. The application can face refusal if it is incomplete in any part or if it fails to meet the nomination criteria. Post assessment, you will receive an email about the result of an application.</p>
					  <p><b>Another critical point that needs to be mentioned here is that an unsuccessful subclass 190 applications stands the chance to be considered for subclass 491 skilled work regional (provisional) visa nominations. To avail of this, you must include subclass 491 as an option on your SkillSelect expression of interest (EOI). Unsuccessful subclass 190 applicants who do not go for these two options will get approval for a visa state nomination.</b></p>
					  <p>Again, multiple nominations are not allowed. Applicants who are granted a subclass 491 skilled work regional (provisional) visa will not have another chance to apply for a subclass 190 in the future. The subclass 491 visa helps to seek permanent residency by way of a subclass 191 visa. Previous state nominees supported for a subclass 489 visa will need to follow the pathway to permanent residency by way of the subclass 887 visa.</p>
					  <h3>Fee details for service</h3>
					  <p>Applicants need to pay a fee of $220 (GST inclusive) for all Tasmanian visa state nomination applications (subclass 190 and subclass 491). This payment has to be made online during the time of the online application submission process. It is on successful payment of fees that you will apply for further processing.</p>
					  <p>If you face any issue while making the online payment for the application, or if the payment turns unsuccessful, then you can save the application. The application will remain ‘in progress’ for the following two weeks within which the payment must be made. After two weeks, if the payment is still pending and the application is not lodged, then it will lapse.</p>
					  <p>You can make the payment of the amount for successful submission of application only by way of a credit card (Visa or MasterCard). The fee once paid is non-refundable regardless of the outcome of the application.</p>
