                <h3>WHAT IS COMPETENCY-BASED ASSESSMENT (CBA) – APEGS  </h3>
				
                <p class="cenb">Discussion on the Latest Experience Assessment System for Engineering- Competency-Based Assessment Online</p>
				
                <p>Discussion on the database of the Competency-Based Assessment (CBA) has been presented on this page. The database is regarding the current CBA system of 1st January 2019 for engineers-in-training. Applicants or candidates with engineers-in-training already present in the system can click here.</p>
				
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
				
                <p>The ability to practice engineering must be impelled by engineering candidate before being provided with a license. Provision of evidence is the obligation of the applicants based on their experiences of their reasoning aptitude to exercise engineering at a proficient level. </p>

				<p>CBA of engineering analysis has been chosen by many engineering regulators from Canada. Engineers and Geoscientists of British Columbia are associated with the development of the CBA for the benefit of the applicants. In various provinces, a multi-year Pan-Canadian CBA project was executed by the engineering regulators. </p>

				<p>This system was developed in 1st January 2019, has been validated by the APEGS membership in the Annual Meeting held on May 2018. It is applicable for all the nationally and internationally graduated engineers-in-training applicants of APEGS. The candidates will be provided with an option to review their experience through confirmatory assessments. There will be other credentials required for the candidates like experiences in pre-grad, one year in Canadian or parallel environment and four years as engineers-in training. This will also involve the other candidates that are present in the position of engineers-in-training in a Canadian environment. </p>

				<p>It is a reminder to all the candidates that CBA based on the experience of geosciences experience is still under progress. It is being strategized for future implementation of this field of experience in the CBA.</p>

                <br/>
                <h3>Advantages of Competency-Based Assessment </h3>

				<p>There are various processes of observing and measuring traits, motivations, potentials, knowledge base and skill level of a candidate. This defines their competencies in the market. </p>
				<p>CBA allows the candidates to gain a market advantage over their peers.<br/><b>The benefits of the CBA system are:</b></p>

				<ul class="wewre">
				<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Quantitative analysis execution for the candidates utilizing a specific measuring technique. This technique is an integrated form of the current APEGS experience. </li>
				<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Provision of an explicit description and definition of the measurement tool to analyse the preparation of the candidate to gain a license.</li>
				<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Transparent, objectified and consistent analysis of the candidates allows them to gain confidence along with the assessors, employers and validates in the Experience Review Committee. </li>
				</ul>
                <p>These do not change the engineering experience of the candidates rather it gets elevated by us.</p>
				
                <h3>Demonstration of the Competency-Based Assessment Framework</h3>
				
                <p>Seven Competency Categories are utilized for the CBA framework to develop the CBA framework. This is established through 34 skill base or competencies:</p>
				<p>The Competency Framework consists of seven Competency Categories, which are groupings of competencies or skills.</p>
				
                <table class="table timeduration">
							<tr>
								<td>Project and financial management</td>
								<td>[5 competencies]</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Technical competence</td>
								<td>[10 competencies]</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Team effectiveness</td>
								<td>[2 competencies]</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Professional accountability</td>
								<td>[6 competencies]</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Communication</td>
								<td>[3 competencies]</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Personal continuous professional development (CPD)</td>
								<td>[3 competencies]</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Social, economic, environmental and sustainability</td>
								<td>[5 competencies]</td>
							</tr>
    
				</table>
				
				
                <p>These categories define the fields of disciplines that guarantee the public and private safety of professional engineers. Key competencies are required in each competency category of that field. The Retail Documents of the Competency Assessment Guide are provided below. </p>

				<p>Competency Rating Scale is utilized to determine the achievement levels of the candidates from 0-5. Addressing each of the competencies is the responsibility of the candidates. The ‘entry to practice’ category requires a candidate to at least achieve 2 to 3 rating level.</p>

                <h3>APEGS Membership Classifications </h3>
				
                <p>There are four kinds of membership for geoscientists or engineers in APEGS. Membership benefits, voting rights, volunteer participation can be gained by a candidate after becoming a member of APEGS.</p>
				
                <h4 class="kao">Member-In-Training </h4>
				
                <p>This category refers to the engineers who have not acquired the work experience, delivered references or attained the Professional Practice Exam. </p>
				
				<h4 class="kao">Professional Member </h4>
				
                <p>This category is for the candidates who have achieved and provided all the required credentials for geosciences work or engineering practices. </p>
				
				<h4 class="kao">Engineering Licensee / Geoscience Licensee </h4>
				
                <p>This category is for the members who have not achieved the academic credentials for P.Geo or P.Eng. </p>
                <p>The privileges of a P.Eng, and P.Geo, are similar to those of a licensee. However, the scope of the licensee and a professional are viably dissimilar. To ensure the validity of your academic credentials contact Kate MacLachlan and Tina Maki. There is no application fee liable to the candidates applying as geoscientist-in-training or engineer-in-training.</p>
				
				<h4 class="kao">Life Member</h4>
				
                <p>Life member refers to the members who are above the age of 65 and retired from work. Annual license fee or membership fee payment is free for life members. In order to apply for life membership, send the below-stated statement to the APEGS office via letter, email or fax: “I want to apply for life membership as I am eligible and meet all requirements of life membership”. </p>
				
				<h4 class="kao">Temporary Licensee </h4>
				
                <p>Professional engineers who have registration in Cedula in Mexico or the state of Texas can apply for a temporary license. In order to gain a more detailed description of eligibility, go to the Temporary License page. Additionally, temporary Licensees has the advantage of not to write in the professional practice exam. Please note that a temporary license holder is not a member of APEGS, thereby, cannot vote for council or meetings such as annual and special assembly.</p>
				
				<h4 class="kao">Membership Requirements </h4>
				
                <p>In order to become a professional member (P.Geo or P-Eng) and hold a licence in Engineering and Geoscience, five requirements must be considered. </p>
				<p>Becoming a professional member requires fulfilment of member-in-training process. Fulfilment of the member-in-training process primarily requires meeting up the academic requirements.  Additionally, four key requirements must be fulfilled to be counted as a professional member. Hence, it can be defined that becoming a geoscientist or engineer the below-enlisted requirements must be undertaken.</p>
				
                <ul class="wewre">
					<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Academic requirements </li>
					<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Work experience </li>
					<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Proficiency in the English language </li>
					<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Professional practice exam </li>
					<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Featuring an honest and good character </li>
				</ul>
									
               <p>Continue to watch the Member-in-Training for gaining core insights on becoming a licensed holder of P.Geo or P.Eng.</p>
				
               <h4 class="kao">Significant!</h4>
				
                <p>In case APEGS discovers that an applicant or member who are not be able to fulfil the Good Character Guideline, then appropriate actions will be taken. </p>
				
				
				<h3>What is Work Experience Reporting – APEGS for Members in Training, Supervisors and Mentors</h3>
				
				<p>Experience reporting is mainly for the registered members-in-training and is also applicable for member-in-training applicants like international graduates. However, these applicants must have been assigned with confirmatory exams and is bestowed with the option of submitting work experience to waive confirmatory exams. </p>
				
				
				<h4 class="kao">Here are some basic guidelines for completing the work experience reports:</h4>
				
				<p>The work experience report is helpful for developing written communication skills for member-in-trainings. <br/><b>Follow the below guidelines for writing the report:</b></p>
				
				<ul class="wewre">
					<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>A professional level quality of the reports should be maintained, which must be the same as that of the engineering or Geo-science report done for clients and supervisors. Experience reporting is considered as a peer review process which effectively means that a number of peer groups would be reading the report.</li>
					<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Make sure to provide clear and concise report, which means you should avoid all the unnecessary information</li>
					<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Make use of your professional judgment and provide examples from work, which will attract the attention of assessors</li>
					<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>It is supremely important to state what are the projects done and how they have been done. Do not use up more space than the given ones in the form of text boxes, but the supervisors can do so for stating extra information</li>
					<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Be specific with your information, especially while stating project experience. A typical Resume style content would not be suitable in this case. </li>
					<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Your supervisor would have more knowledge on your working stance in projects and thus their contribution is empirical. However, specific information and suitable information must be there such that it helps the Experience Review Committee to review your information and make a judgment. </li>
				</ul>
				
				<p><b>The information should include:</b></p>
				
				<ul class="wewre">
					<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i><b>What you did in the project exactly:</b> for example, the background of specific engineering or Geo-science project, your role in the project, circumstances faced and others. </li>
					<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i><b>Why did you do that specific project:</b> reasons for  engaging on the project, your role and how it satisfies your needs, any specific contribution</li>
					<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i><b>The outcome:</b> what was the outcome of the project, any comments regarding that</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p class="cenb">Specifically, your report should cover WHAT you did, HOW you did it, WHY did you do it and WHAT were the outcomes of the project. </p>
				
				<ul class="wewre">
					<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Further, your roles in the project must be stated and for that background information of the project is necessary. Each point should consist of a statement with first person singular tense. Avoid using terms like “assisted”, “involved” or “participated” and any similar references to your work because these words sound generic and does not adds value for your personal contribution to the project. </li>
					<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>State your progress from the previous role (if any). Here, work is an experience can range from 5- 55 and hence your report must state how your role changed over the experience, rise of complexity and your response towards complex procedures. </li>
					<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>You can also state a single project example in different areas of the report. For example, one of your projects may demonstrate application of a theory like assisting in design of a component, management activities like (monitoring costs and supervising technicians) and awareness of social implications. However, it is always better to state different experiences in the report for portraying your capabilities of working in different fields and circumstances.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>One of the main reasons why reports fail and need resubmission is because of generic information, vague statements and irrelevant explanations. For example, if someone asks about your project experience, you should state the experience, field of experience and each te of experience. If you are somehow concerned with the confidentiality of information, you may use surrogate names like project X, projypect Y or any other names. However, let your supervisor know, which one is which project beforehand. </p>
