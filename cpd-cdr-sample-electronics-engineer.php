                <p>I have been a firm believer of the saying “there is no end to learning, but there are many beginnings”. From the very beginning, I was highly interested in the field of electronics and communications engineering and hence decided to complete a diploma in electronics and communication engineering after passing year 10. I completed my diploma study from Gujarat Technological University, Gujarat, India, which is a very reputed university in India. I further went on to pursue Bachelor’s in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the same University.</p>
                <p>During my undergraduate degree, I undertook many projects and, in the process, gained some hands-on experience with the hardware.<br/><b> Some of my training and short courses were:</b></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>A course on fibre optical communication, microwave engineering, communication engineering, mobile communication, etc. as per my subject requirement.</li>
                  <li>Various courses on a number of programming languages like C, assembly language during my undergraduate study.</li>
                  <li>Core subjects like digital electronics, analog electronic circuits, microcontrollers, etc.</li>
                  <li>Attended electronics workshops, and have studied engineering drawing as a part of my subject requirement.</li>
                  <li>Visited many industries during my Undergraduate study to further enhance my basic electronics concepts.</li>
                  <li>Worked on Door Locking System, Underwater communication system, and many more projects during my undergraduate study.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>After finishing my Bachelor studies, I decided continue my studies. I was always willing to study overseas. Therefore, I decided to move to Australia for higher studies. I undertook master’s training in the field of telecommunications engineering from the University of South Australia, Adelaide, Australia. Here I gained more in-depth knowledge about basic communication systems by engaging in many projects, thesis and research work, and utilized the opportunity to widen my knowledge.</p>
                <p>I believe that I possess good knowledge in this field of engineering and capable of gaining even more. I would like to strengthen my learning further and a job in the same field would be beneficial for me to further understand the practical concepts of engineering.</p>
