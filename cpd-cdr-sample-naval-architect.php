                   <h3>How to Pen Down CPD for EA</h3>
                   <p>CPD is a report or documentation of the skills attained by the engineer while working as an engineer. This shows the advancement of the engineer and the measures taken by the individual to aid his or her advancement in his or her particular trade of engineering.</p>
                   <p>There is a format for writing the CPD of a CDR. The format should give detailed information on the duration, location, and achievement from the training. It should include each and everything whether formal and informal work the engineer is doing for the advancement of his or her career. So, below is the format by following which one has to write down the CPD for Engineers Australia. You have to strictly adhere to this format because it is laid down by none other than the EA.</p>

                           <p>The course can be done on campus or through distance education. It should have some sort of assessment test.</p>
                        </div>

                           <p>This will include the technical meetings which will include the presentations of EA. Workshops and seminars will be done by the third-party practitioner.</p>
                        </div>

                           <p>This is an important trait. The engineer that learns from the normal activities of the workplace such as seminars or group discussions should be written here.</p>

                           <p>CPD writing refers to Continuing Professional Development writing which is another important part of CDR and must not be taken for granted. It aims to provide information of how an engineer is trying to stay up-to-date with the advancement and changing technology and gives an overview of how much an engineer is inclined to the profession to be passionate enough to keep track of the latest information and have the latest skillset.</p>
                           <p>It is information of the workshops, conferences attended, projects undertaken and contributions made to journals or references to enhance one’s skills and knowledge. It shows how much you strive and to stay aligned to your chosen field of engineering.

                    <p>CPD is documentation or report of your knowledge, skills, and training gained by you as an engineer. It must depict that you are up-to-date with all the latest advances in your field of Engineering. It also helps you to prepare a document of the knowledge base you have developed till date and your skills that you have gained. Engineer’s Australia has specified the format of CPD and what it should include. While preparing a CPD, you must keep in mind the following few things:</p>
                    <ul class="list10">
                        <li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> It should be in the form of a list and represented in chronological order.</li>
                        <li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> It must not exceed one page but should contain the detailed information of workshops and conferences including location, duration, and skills achieved</li>
                        <li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> It should contain data pertaining to both formal and informal background.</li>
                         <li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>It is not required to attach certificates of courses and events.</li>
                         <li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> It must include information on conferences attended, papers delivered, short courses, workshops, seminars, technical meetings attended, presentations prepared.</li>

                   <p>Usually, CPD writing involves information based on two perspectives: training based and development based. Training based is the formal part of the CPD writing where information related to enhancing skills and knowledge is provided.</p>
                   <p>Development part is more of an informal approach where the entirety of the individual and the competency as an engineer is projected. The ability and will to develop as an engineer are both depicted from a fully formatted CPD. It shows an individual’s skills, knowledge as well as other attributes of management, leadership, mentorship, academics, writing skills, communications which are equally important in any reputed organization or firm.</p>
