                            <h3>What is CDR Report?</h3>
                            <p>If your dream is to go to Australia and work there as an engineer, then you must be aware of the CDR or Competency Demonstration Report. It is a report that you have to send to the Engineers Australia and get their approval for the Migration Skills Visa. Without CDR, you dream of becoming an engineer in Australia will remain only a dream.</p>
                              <p>Basically, there are three parts in CDR report which are Career Episodes or CE, Continuous Professional Development or CPD along with the Resume or CV, and Summary Statement or SS. You need to make sure that all the parts of the CDR are written properly. Otherwise, you will struggle to get the job you want.</p>
                              
                              <p>The Career Episode writing has to be of minimum 1000 words and should not exceed 2500 words. After that, you have to prepare Continuous Professional Development or CPD. You have to include all the programs and seminars you have attended and all the other activities you have done in order to enhance your career as an engineer.</p>
                              
                              <p>After that, you have to write the summary statement which is equally important as it gives the EA members a brief and compact overview of the whole CDR. Now, let’s see what the job opportunities are that you will have with the CDR in Australia.</p>

                        <h2>Plagiarized content</h2>

                        <p>There are very high chances that your submitted CDR or KA02 gets rejected because it contains content which is considered as plagiarized. It may be possible that you copy the content from a sample which already exists or from another CDR. Also, it may be possible that you accidently end up becoming a culprit of it. Make sure that you hire us for a high quality and plagiarism free report. This is possible because we use advanced software to check for plagiarism in each and every sentence of a document. </p>

                        <h2>Error in content</h2>

                        <p>If your report contains some grammatical error or any other error and the EA authorities detect it, your CDR will get rejected. Submitting an error free report is very important to avoid rejection.</p>

                        <h2>Improper format</h2>

                        <p>There is a proper format which you are required to follow. If there is a mistake in making the report in the prescribed format, your KA02 is very likely to be rejected. You can hire our experts for getting assistance in writing such reports. Our experts are highly experienced and they are very well aware of all the formats which are related to CDR and KA02.</p>

                        <h2>Word limit</h2>

                        <p>The reports are to be written in a specific word limit. As already discussed, this word limit is prescribed very clearly in the guidelines. If you are not following the word limit, your CDR will get rejected. You don’t have to think about the word limit if you are hiring us for your help.</p>

                        <h2>False information</h2>

                        <p>You have to mention certain personal details regarding your job profile, work experience, past projects and your past responsibilities. Make sure that the details which you are providing are true and are not at all false.
