       <p>A competency demonstration report (CDR) is a skills assessment report that is required by designated assessment authorities for admission of migrants into Engineers Australia. This report is often developed for engineering students who wish to settle in Australia but their countries lack accreditation from EA. The report must contain documentary evidence of important engineering knowledge and skills from students who wish to have it. CDR is a requirement for students who wish to have their skills and competencies matched with those of Australian standards. Having the report at hand will enable students showcase their candidature as the right students for engineering studies in Australia.</p>

        <p>Yes. English competency is a key requirement for skilled migration arrangements. In addition, all engineering lessons in Australia will be offered in English. By proving one’s ability in English Language Proficiency with a pass in the English Language Test, the complexity of getting migrant access to Australia is eliminated. There are several English tests which are conducted such as IELTS, TOEFL iBT and PTE. For admission, a candidate should pass all the assigned English tests in order to get proficiency in listening, reading, writing, and speaking the language.</p>

        <p>Competency Demonstration Reports consist of three critical parts. These are the three career episodes, a summary statement, and a continuous professional development (CPD) report. The Three Career Episodes outline the actual work and activities an engineer has undertaken. The Summary Statement is prepared based on reference points captured by the Three Career Episodes. A Continuous Professional Development (CPD) report is the final part of the CDR which outlines the courses, trainings, seminars, readings, and workshops among others that engineers have undertaken to enhance their engineering knowledge and skills.</p>
