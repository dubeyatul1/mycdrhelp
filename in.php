                 <h3>How to Write an Effective CDR with Our Help!</h3>
                  
                 <p>Many engineers plan to migrate to Australia or New Zealand to get better work opportunities and earn more. If you have experience of working in the engineering field in India, you can easily get Australian or New Zealand visa by preparing an effective CDR or KA02 respectively. But preparing an impressive and plagiarism free CDR or KA02 is a challenging task in itself. </p>
				<p>Competency Demonstration Report (CDR) is a report demonstrating an engineer’s skills and experience on the basis of which the hiring authority Engineers Australia hires engineers and approves their will of working in Australia. Likewise, if you want to immigrate to New Zealand, Knowledge Assessment (KA02) has to prepare in a similar way to CDR. </p>
				<p>There are special sets of guidelines and conduct prescribed by the deciding authorities which you need to follow in order to get your CDR approved. A similar document called (recognition prior learning) is also preferred by some candidates to get their visa approved. </p>

To start with, it is mandatory report you have to submit to Engineers Australia if you are an engineer who want to migrate abroad to get your field related post. There are a limited number of seats to be filled up by EA. That’s why they assess your skills and qualifications through KA02 or CDR and make sure that the candidate they are choosing for their country is suitable and highly skilled. The authorities test you in a number of ways even the way you write in your report. This is a golden opportunity of all the Indian engineers who want to work abroad. </p>
						   
							<p>The CDR is subdivided into different parts. There are three career episodes, Continuous Professional Development (CPD), Curriculum Vitae (CV) and summary statement. All these parts have to written in a prescribed format. Also, there is word limit for all the parts and you have to strictly adhere to the word limit. You have to provide the best content for all these parts as they all are very important. Preparing a competency report is a time consuming process. There are any other guidelines which you have to follow provided by EA. Hiring us will give you a professional and imposing report.  </p>

                      <p>After completing the bachelors degree of four years in engineering, if you decide to do a two year advanced diploma in the same engineering branch, you are qualifies for an engineering associate position. It is a more advanced position. You can work on this post in abroad as well by mentioning it in your CDR. The two year diploma is like a cherry on a cake and will definitely increase the chances of EA accepting your report. </p>

                     <h2>Engineering Manager</h2>
					 
                    <p>It is a job related post. You can become an engineering manager if you have some work experience and you are well aware of the duties and responsibilities which you have to follow while pursuing job as an engineer in any field. This is a higher level of post than engineering associate or professional engineer. </p>
					
					<p>A manager’s job is not easy. You should have all the skills of following the concerns of business i.e. controlling, planning, directing and communicating. You should know the importance of each and every staff member and follow all those steps which will lead your company on the path of growth. Applying for engineering manager through CDR will require you to include all the necessary details. We can help you write a perfect report for the same and within the deadline.</p>

                      <h2>Engineering Technologist</h2>
					  
                     <p>For becoming an engineering technologist, you have to add some skills related to software programs or technological languages along with your bachelor’s degree. You must have a very good command on the technological programs and software used in the foreign place to which you are planning to migrate.</p>
					 
					<p>Following the same, you have to mention all the necessary details regarding your qualification, software programs learned and any special training courses taken. Moreover, you have to pay heed to the specified format and provide all the above details in the same format. You can hire our CDR writing services to get one with error free format and details. </p>
					
					<p>You can apply for all the above posts by writing a decent and genuine Competency Demonstration Report or KA02. The above posts are different from each other and you need varied skills and qualifications. But one thing which remains same is the guidelines provided by EA. Make sure you follow all of them very carefully to get your dream job at your dream destination.</p>
