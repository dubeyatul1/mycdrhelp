            </ul>
            <p><b>3. Personal Engineering Activity</b></p>
            <p>This is important part of the “Career Episode Report” and is subject of narrative and important evaluable components. You should define the function you did as an engineer in this section, which would not exceed 1000 words. Here you can emphasize your role and contribution in project. And don't make mistakes because of team activities.</p>
            <p>Things to include are:</p>

            <p><b>4. Include Creative Design</b></p>
            <p>The Design activities have very higher priority in CDR evaluation. If your CDR report contains technically creative designs, then your report is likely to receive a positive assessment. That's why, you must explain whole technical experience and artistic engineering about design activities, in addition, make assured to highpoint it.</p>
            <p><b>5. Include Technical Difficulties</b></p>
            <p>The details of the project you are involved in and the exact content you contribute to project are an integral part of your career. When writing a CDR report, each project heads to few technical problems or issues. At least 3 technical problems/issues should be stated in the CDR report. When you include a problem declaration in a professional drama set, you must cite the steps to resolve them.</p>
            <p><b>6. Details About Project Management</b></p>
            <p>The Project management is responsible for overseeing the project to achieve goals, timelines and budgets.

Be sure to cover technical details (such as plans), assign tasks to the team associates, and set deadlines for every task in the report.</p>
            <p><b>7. Summary of Career Episodes</b></p>
            <p>Length of this part is 50-100 words. You require to pay consideration to technical representatives plus your conclusions. An outline of overall situation, mentioning the approaches you implement and portraying your technology development while pursuing technology development. Don't forget to involve the succeeding information:</p>
            <ul class="wewre">
            <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Complete project picture
            <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Contribution to project
            <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>The project is expected to achieve its requirements and goals
            </ul>


            <p><b>8. Avoid Plagiarism</b></p>

              <h3>Continuing Professional Development (CPD)</h3>
                  
              <p>CPD writing is one of the most important step towards skill assessment Australia. Continuing Professional Development writing is something that you just cannot afford to neglect. It will provide information about the engineer’s current activities. As an engineer, you will learn many things while working in an organization. A CPD report conveys each and everything that you will learn in the organization. You can sum it up by saying that CPD writing will be an up-to-date report of what the engineer is doing and learning at the present times.</p>
              <h4 class="kao">What is a Continuing Professional Development for Engineers Australia?</h4>
              <p>CPD is a documentation or report of your knowledge, skills, and training gained by you as an engineer. It must depict that you are up-to-date with all the latest advances in your field of Engineering. It also helps you to prepare a document of the knowledge base you have developed till date and your skills that you have gained. Engineer’s Australia has specified the format of CPD and what it should include.<br/> While preparing a CPD, you must keep in mind the following few things:</p>
              <ul class="list10">
              <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>It should be in the form of a list and represented in chronological order. 
              <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>It must not exceed one page but should contain the detailed information of workshops and conferences including location, duration, and skills achieved 
              <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>It should contain data pertaining to both formal and informal background. 
              <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>It is not required to attach certificates of courses and events. 
              <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>It must include information on conferences attended, papers delivered, short courses, workshops, seminars, technical meetings attended, presentations prepared. 
              <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Volunteer services to the engineering field or mentoring students. 
              </ul>

              <input type="checkbox" class="read-more-state" id="post-1" />
              <p class="read-more-wrap">
              <span class="read-more-target">Usually, CPD writing involves information based on two perspectives: training based and development based. Training based is the formal part of the CPD writing where information related to enhancing skills and knowledge is provided. Development part is more of an informal approach where the entirety of the individual and the competency as an engineer is projected. The ability and will to develop as an engineer are both depicted from a fully formatted CPD. It shows an individual’s skills, knowledge as well as other attributes of management, leadership, mentorship, academics, writing skills, communications which are equally important in any reputed organization or firm.
              The Engineers Australia requires a Continuing Professional Development (CPD) report to conduct an immigration technical assessment. A CPD ensures that engineers are up to date on the latest growths in the engineering field. The CPD provides the essential information: the title, duration, date and location of training. You don't need to include multiple A4 pages in the Continuing Professional list. CPD actions are outlined to update and expand your skills and knowledge, and to uphold technical skills, successfully handle changes and better serve the community. Participate in the CPD activities to increase your network and contacts.
