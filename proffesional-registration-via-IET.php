			         <h3>Professional Registration VIA IET</h3>
					 <h4 class="kao">What is IET in Professional Registration?</h4>
					<p>IET is a license provided to expert technicians and engineers by the Engineering Council and this is considered as a reward for the professional engineering qualifications that are described in UK Standard for Professional Engineering Competence (UK-SPEC). In addition, this is also considered as a specialised dignity for the engineers. Licensed bodies like the ‘Engineering Councils’, provide dignity for the engineers who have competence, knowledge and commitment to activity of professionalism. IET has the license to award the followings:</p>

					</ul>
				
				
					<p><b>Employment</b></p>
				
					
					<h4 class="kao">Description of Role</h4>

					<p>In addition, Unit boxes and Ranks are associated with the ones joining from ‘Armed Forces’. You can make selection for the voluntary roles to be considered for registration application along with print out of ‘master CV record’ or registration application. The size of the application form for professional registration depends upon amount of text and word counts included in the ‘responsibilities’ and ‘achievements’ sections that are mentioned below.</p>

					<ul class="list10">
					<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Professional registration for services in own field need complete description of employment and voluntary work status.

					<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>For this particular section you need to highlight own qualities and competencies in. Showcasing your skills and competencies would help to lure the attention of interviewers so that when you walk in, they are already impressed. </li>
					<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Other than this, you should also present you responsibilities and contributions instead of just a bland description of your job. Maintain a character count of 3000 for this. </li>
					</ul>

					<ul class="list10">
					<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Clear demonstration of individual job role and responsibility. Focus on “I” rather than “we” </li>
					<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Make less usage of unnecessary Jargons. </li>
					<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Illustration of capabilities and competencies in job role should be specifically demonstrated. Try to provide exact and particular example of job role that supports the responsibly of applicant individual and is relevant in describing role and competencies in previous organisations.

					<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Indicate your responsibility and role in handling complex tasks are to be mentioned in this portion.

					<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Thus, it is the applicant’s responsibility to clearly demonstrate roles, responsibilities and liabilities that were performed with care and discipline. This makes it easier for interviewers and makes it flexible for them to understand the competencies and capabilities of an interviewee. Provide a clear summary of your own capabilities and keep in mind that this will be your selling point and hence be careful about this. </li>
					<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>The submitted application for professional registration is primarily checked by IET staff.
