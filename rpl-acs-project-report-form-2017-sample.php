<p>Misleading and false information is viewed as a major breach of ethical behaviour and will seriously jeopardise your migration prospects.</p> 

<p>It is your responsibility to indicate when you have drawn on the work of others.  Other people's original ideas and methods should be clearly distinguished, and other people's words, illustrations and diagrams should be clearly indicated regardless of whether they are copied exactly, paraphrased, or adapted. </p>

<p>Failure to acknowledge your source by clear citation and referencing constitutes plagiarism.  All plagiarism will be assessed as not suitable and reported to the Department of Immigration and Border Protection.</p>

In some cases, you may be asked to submit project reports and other written work submitted with the application for screening by plagiarism detection services.</p> 

<p>If at any stage in the assessment process plagiarism is detected, the information may be provided to other Australian Government agencies.  The assessment will be terminated and the outcome recorded as unsuitable.  A refund of the application fee cannot be provided for cases assessed as containing false information or plagiarism.</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 18px;">SECTION 2 - RPL PROJECT REPORTS</h2>

<p>A project report is a clear written description of a project or engagement that provides you with the opportunity to show how you perform as an ICT Professional.</p> 

<p>Each report is to relate to a significant project or work episode undertaken by you during your professional ICT career.</p> 

<p>The purpose of these reports is to enable you to demonstrate your command and implementation of the Areas of Knowledge described in Section 1 of this application. </p>

<p><b>Please Note: You are required to provide two project reports.</b></p>

<p>Of the two reports, one must apply to a project undertaken within the last three years, and the other for a project within the last five years.</p>
<p><b>Projects over two years long may be used for both reports under either of the following conditions:</b></p>
<ul class="list10">
<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>The project has clearly-defined work efforts which took place in parallel, each with their own solution development and design activities and their own deliverables.</li>
<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>The project had clearly-defined phases that were executed in succession, each with its own solution development and design activities and deliverables. Note that a second project phase that constructs and implements the solution developed by the first phase does not meet this requirement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on the nature of your role in each project, the Project Report should cover an appropriate selection of factors. </p>

<p><b>Appropriate factors will be determined based on the type of ICT project selected.  Possible factors include:</b></p>
<ul class="list10">
<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>System Analysis and Design and Software Engineering methodologies used.</li>
<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Contribution to the processes involved in the design and implementation of enterprise-wide computing systems.</li>
<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Programming languages, design paradigms and implementation procedures adopted.</li>
<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Database and/or file design and management techniques employed</li>
<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Network topologies, including size, distribution and security facilities installed</li>
<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Project Management and quality assurance techniques followed</li>
<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Internet application design, including database interactivity and security measures implemented</li>
<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>ICT managerial activities, demonstrating the nature and extent of responsibilities</li>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p><b>The following pages provide a template for your reports.</b></p>

<p>When writing your reports please provide your own thoughts - do not just copy project documentation.</p>  

<p>Please use the first person in your discussion, so it is clear to the assessor what you did versus what others did - say "I did X" rather than "X was done".</p>  

<p>Diagrams from the project documentation may be helpful, but the text should be in your own words. Please ensure that diagrams are relevant, readable, and help the assessor to understand what you did as a member of the project team.</p>

<p>If sections of the Project Report template (see below) are not relevant to your participation in the project, then leave the section blank.</p>

<p>Focus on quality rather than quantity. <b>Each Project Report should be no more than four or five pages in length.</b></p>

<h2>SPECIAL NOTE:</h2>

<p>By submitting this RPL Knowledge and Project Report form as a component of your ACS skills assessment application, you agree with the following statemen</p>

<p><b>The applicant confirms that the explanation of their knowledge and project reports submitted in this application truthfully and accurately describe the applicant and the applicant's personal involvement in the projects. The applicant is aware that plagiarism by the applicant will automatically invalidate this application, will jeopardise any future applications from the applicant and will be reported by the Australian Computer Society to the Australian Department of Immigration and Border Protection.</b></p>
