								 <h3>SECTION 1-KEY AREAS OF KNOWLEDGE</h3>
								<p>In the following expandable typing areas, explain how you have acquired your in-depth knowledge in these topic areas through your professional experience.</p>
								<p class="cenb">Please refer to the ACS Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) Instruction document for more detail</p>
								<h2>Essential Core ICT Area of Knowledge:</h2>
								<p>How have you acquired this knowledge in your working environment? Illustrate your depth of knowledge.</p>
								<p>When I was student in Electronic Engineering field in University, (the mid 90's) the digital age in our country had not yet reached the maturity in higher education system and inevitably all academic resources were limited to the analogue era. Periods of transistors and logic circuits, pulse technique and analogue television and telecommunication circuits. But my rational mind at that time led me to deep learning about microprocessor programming, and that is why I started my specialty in digital electronics and completed my undergraduate degree in building a digital music synthesizer on 486 Series of computers.</p>
								<p>Due to the specific circumstances of my country and the technology sanctions of the 90s, the electronics industry in Iran was considered a dead industry, and then I graduated from university. After a short while I completed the military service (public mandatory service for all the men) and by considering the critical conditions of the electronics industry and especially my deep interested in this field Immediately after completing my military service (lasted for two years after graduating from university) I enrolled in a Network + course (in 2001), I had taught much of the Network + course materials at the university theoretically, but practically I had no experience in the Network + course. Many of my undergraduate courses were practically reviewed for topics like network and its structure, network cable and its types and how to build a network cable, IP addressing, and various classes of IP, VLAN, Hub and its applications, switch and how it works, router and its structure and how routers are routed, the structure of Windows server operating system and some important networking services like DHCP, DNS, NTP, etc. In general, learning these things by doing some practical tasks like building a network cable, setting up a LAN with proper IP addressing, installing a windows server and setting up some important services like DHCP were on the practical projects that I did during this course. After going through this course in consultation with my friends, I decided to enrol in a CCNA route and switch course (in 2002). I had a good view to computer networks because it completely relates to how the two computers interact with each other and by considering the interpretation that the OSI model and the TCP / IP model provide. I also got to know the structure Mac table of Cisco switches and how to build different VLANs in these switches and the mechanism of loop blocking in Cisco switches with the help of Spanning-tree protocol and also I got to know some interesting subjects about aggregating some physical interface each other and building a virtual interface where instead of the capacity of a physical link, I could use all of these links simultaneously by using the Ether channel mechanism, and how to create a static Route as well as Routing protocols.</p>
								<p>I learned about dynamics like OSPF, EOGRP, BGP as well as access list, NAT, and some concepts related to Earth WAN information such as Frame lay. I got into a CCNP course immediately after completing this course to complete my knowledge of Cisco networks. Attending this course actually deepened my knowledge of Routing and switching. During this course, I fully learned the STP protocol (PVST, RSTP, MSTP) as well as the VTP, DTP, and I had great knowledge with First Hop Redundancy Protocols (HSRP, VRRP, GLBP) and how to configure them through implementation I learned practical projects, as well as NAT by doing a scenario I was able to practice the applications of this protocol practically by creating ACL access to some servers in the environment I limited my time in the field as well as developing my OSPF, BGP, and EIGRP scenarios. After completing these courses, I began my search for the right job and succeeded in 2004 as an engineer at Deep Com Asia Networking. The first task assigned to me by the company manager was to set up a CCTV network and traffic control system, and with the successful execution of this project, the technical manager assigned me some tasks such as configuring routers and Cisco switches, Setting up the server and installing windows server and some network services including DHCP. In addition to my server monitoring I also worked in networking and communications. I worked for the company until 2010. Working in the company provided me with a very practical experience. In 2010, I received a very good offer from KosarCom R&D Group, which was actually a technical management post (network and infrastructure group) for four years overseeing the technical team's work on many infrastructure projects. I was involved in setting up network services (Active Directory, SUS, exchange) to network mechanisms (designing, configuring, and setting up WAN communications). During my career at this company to enhance my security knowledge, I enrolled in a CCNA security course (in 2012). I enrolled in this course with security issues such as DOS, DDOS, Spoofing. And also I got acquainted with firewalls configuration, and then expanded my knowledge of this field by watching CCNP security training videos. I participated in a recruitment test of an affiliated company of Social Insurance Organization in 2014, and after taking the exam I was accepted successfully so I worked as a network expert in this huge company. In addition to designing and deploying LAN, WAN networks, I also launch network services and communications monitoring. In recent years, I have been updating my information in some courses, such as the Mikrotik foundation in 2016, VMware Foundation in 2017 courses and Data Center Course in 2019. I have participated and added to my skills by participating in various infrastructure projects.</p>

								<h3>Teamwork Concepts and Issues</h3>
								<p>The most important lesson I learned during my career in various projects was teamwork and commitment to project team goals. First of all, I had to pay attention to the corporate culture of the company. Succeeding in such projects on a national scale, need careful organize that strives to pursue its goals through successful teamwork. So we had to create successful teamwork patterns within the company. Whether I wanted it or not, the team was made up of people who brought set of positive and negative characters and features into the project space. So people who were fundamentally different, had different life experiences, and had different levels of success, had to work together towards a common goal and mission. Given the complexity of forming a group based on conscious or unconscious norms and guidelines, finding a group that would ultimately work effectively was surprising and complex. My presence as a key member and project supervisor should have significantly enhanced the ability to collaborate to meet the needs of the team. Supporting and supplying information at the right time was far beyond my ability at the time, so I had many challenges on my way to success, but it was a very rewarding experience for me.</p>
								<h3>General ICT Area of Knowledge:</h3>
								<p><b>1. Hardware and Software Fundamental</b></p>
								<p>Looking back over my years in this field, I can say that I deal with most of the common Cisco and Microsoft hardware and software in my country, from switches such as cisco catalyst 2560,2960,3650,3750,3850 to various switches. Nexus series and various routers from 800,1800,1900,2800,2900,3800,7200 series router and all popular IOS 12 to IOS 14 and in network services running windows server 2000, 2003,2008,2012,2016 software Like exchange server 2012, 2016 and services like NTP DHCP, DNS, ... and equipment like Mikrotik's route boards and HP's G7, G8, and G9 servers are just some of the hardware and software that I've been dealing with.</p>
								<p><b>2- Data Communication and Networking</b></p>
								<p>Network knowledge is a set of design, implementation, and troubleshooting solutions, and to gain this knowledge you need to learn the basics step by step. In my opinion, the key to learn the infrastructure of the Network is the Network plus course (I passed this course in 2001) and the first step in learning network-based Cisco is Gaining knowledge in Routing and Switching Which Starts at CCNA and after that is CCNP course (I passed CCNA Routing and Switching course in 2002). I have learned many key concepts about routing and switching over the years, along with that I have domination in network security (I passed CCNA security in 2012), Microsoft services, Virtualization, Configuration knowledge of Mikrotik devices, Configuration of Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers, Configuration CCCT and other MVR headers. In recent years I have done studies on telephone centers with open source structure that have become popular in many countries. Here I am going to point out some of the concepts that I have learned about them. 
								<p class="para"><b>It should be noted that some security concepts are along with some definitions that are highly dependent on the work of a network engineer:</b></p>
								<ul class="list10">
								<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i><b>P address: </b>I can say that one of the most logical components of an IP address network is actually an IP address to communicate between hosts in the network, or better to say, every device in the network is used with another device with a 32-bit string which is defined in different classes that by using VLSM smaller subnets can be created.</li>
								<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i><b>DHCP server: </b>I can honestly say no large or even medium-sized network can be imagined without a DHCP server, which manages to allocate IP address to all hosts and network servers play a huge role in reducing network admins problems such as duplicate addresses.</li>
								<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i><b>DHCP snooping: </b>Today, in many networks in order to prevent intrusion through fake DHCP servers deploy to DHCP snooping network access switch.</li>
								<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i><b>ARP: </b>In fact, when a host on the network wants to communicate with another host calls its IP address and the role of ARP is to convert the IP address to MAC in the network and vice versa.</li>
								<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i><b>ARP inspection: </b>I know in Cisco switches to prevent ARP poisoning and ARP spoofing attacks this mechanism is used that splits switch ports into Trusted and Untrusted ones, and all ARP packets that are inserted into untrusted ports are carefully inspected.</li>
								<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i><b>Windows server: </b>I have used Windows version servers as a platform to launch services such as DHCP, DNS, NTP, Active directory</li>
								<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i><b>Group Policy: </b>We use Group policy when we want to apply a Policy to all hosts, such as the capability to change the IP address by a regular user which is limited on all network clients.</li>
								<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i><b>WDS server: </b>With the launch of WDS, we have been able to install a network-based operating system in the enterprise suite, but recently we have launched a centralized updated of Windows operating systems with the launch of WSUS service.</li>
								<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i><b>VLAN: </b>I have divided VLANs over the past few years by creating VLANs in traffic switches. It should be noted that each VLAN has a different IP range than the other VLANs, and to communicate between VLANs the router or switch layer three must be used.</li>
								<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i><b>VTP: </b>When we have a large number of switches on the network, defining network VLANs on all of these switches is time consuming and the probability of error is high. Over the last few years by launching a VTP server I have managed the network VLANs.</li>
								<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i><b>Spanning-tree: </b>Always having Redundant links on the network has been a concern of network administrators because problems such as mac table instability and broadcast storms in network switches will be unavoidable.</li>
								<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i><b>Etherchannel: </b>If the link between two switches does not have the capacity to transmit data between two switches, by launching Etherchannel, we can bundle several physical links and use the capacity of these multiple links to transmit data. These links are viewed by the STP as a logical link and none are disabled.</li>
								<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i><b>FHRP: </b>Another concern of network administrators was the lack of Gateway Redundancy in the third layer network, which can be solved by upgrading to a HSRP, VRRP, GLBP solutions depending on the network conditions.</li>
								<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i><b>Link state protocol: </b>Dynamic routing protocols are classified into three categories: link state, distance vector, hybrid. In a protocol such as OSPF which is of the OSPF type, routers are aware of all the information of the neighbouring routers, even the type of neighbour-to-neighbour link.</li>
								<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i><b>OSPF, OSFP metric, and OSPF AD: </b>are Dynamic Link state routing protocols that routers in each area have comprehensive information about other routers in that area. In OSPF metric is the cost, in fact, the smaller the cost, and the more available bandwidth. Administrative distance routing protocol of the OSPF is one hundred and ten.</li>
								<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i><b>EIGRP, EIGRP metric, and EIGRP AD: </b>I know a dynamic protocol routing is a hybrid type that has very good convergence time. The important elements in determining EIGRP metrics are bandwidth and delay and administrative distance of this protocol is 90.</li>
								<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i><b>Successor and Feasible successor: </b>I know successor is actually the best route to get to the destination to see the successor you have to go to the routing table and the second route, which is actually worse metric than the successor which is called the feasible successor.</li>
								<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i><b>BGP: </b>Wherever there is talk of Internet routing or roaming on a very large scale, this strong protocol routing comes in. This protocol routing is either iBGP (both routers are in one AS) or eBGP (routers are in different AS)</li>
								<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i><b>Route distribution: </b> We use distribution when we want to inject a routing protocol information into another routing protocol.</li>
								<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i><b>SNMP: </b>I use SNMP to monitor the status of network devices. In fact, this information protocol provides us with the ability to monitor the status of network equipment.</li>
								<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i><b>CDP protocol: </b>It is Cisco's proprietary protocol that assists network administrators in collecting information about network-connected devices.</li>
								<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i><b>Virtual machine: </b>By building a VM, I have implemented many network services and applications on virtual machines that save on hardware consumption.</li>
								<li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i><b>Vmotion: </b>A very interesting feature in Virtualization that can be transferred from one server to another while the VMs are on.</li>

							<p><b>1.5. Describe your role(s) and responsibilities in the project.</b></p>
							<p>I worked on this project as a member of the project implementation team at various stages as a network expert, In fact, considering my experience in different projects, I helped the project team at different stages of the project from initial design to final design as well as configuring the devices with testing, connectivity and troubleshooting communications between headquarters and other branches. In fact, along with other team members, I participated in network design, hardware and licensing requirements, router configurations and branch switches and communication between the branches and the central office in the final report.</p>
							<p><b>2. Business Opportunity or Problem</b></p>
							<p><b>2.1. Describe the business opportunity or problem(s) this project addressed.</b></p>
							<p>This project was one of the biggest infrastructure projects in my country. In fact, we were going to establish a connection between the 320 branches of the Social Security Organization with headquarter, so that all of these branches could connect to the central branch servers to do day-to-day tasks and settling client's requests. This project was a national project and considering a large number of people who came to the branch every day to do things such as renewing a medical booklet, doing retirement, getting a disability allowance, etc., so the speed and quality was very important in making contact, and the senior executives of the organization put great pressure on our team to launch this project. We decided to use all our efforts to implement the highest quality project.</p>
							<p><b>3. Solution</b></p>
							<p><b>3.1. Discuss your contribution to the solution, project or engagement.</b></p>
							<p>participated in the project of connecting 320 branches of the Social Security Organization with the data center located in the central building at various stages. In the first phase of the project, we designed the preliminary communications design with other members of the design team with the help of Microsoft Visio software. During the configuration phase of the equipment, I helped the project team with the large number of routers and network switches in the configuration of the equipment. As a result of segmentation, I set up the final setup and fixed the connection between the central branch and the branches. I also helped the project manager with the final report.</p>
							<p><b>3.2. Describe any design or problem solving methods you used on this project.</b></p>
							<p>Our first step in launching the project was to create a lab environment using GNS3 software in which one router was configured as a Headquarter router and three as a Branch router:</p>
							<p>After this step we started designing a new IP addressing network. The first point in designing IP addressing was designing the IP address for WAN communications and the second was designing the IP address of each branch's internal network. Perhaps the most important point in designing IP addressing was the proper use of VLSM. In fact, the use of / 30 ranges for Point-To-Point WAN communications and side tunnel addresses and designing appropriate subnets for each branch was based on the number of hosts and predicting a possible increase in the number of hosts in the future. For example, for a branch with 20 hosts we used a range of /27 with 30 usable IP addresses. In the following graph there is an example of an IP address project design:</p>
							<p>After designing IP addressing, it was time to launch DMVPN between the headquarter and the branches. Before deploying operation, we first tested this solution with a DMVPN tunnel between the headquarter and one of the branches and after successful testing we started configuring other offices:</p>
							<p>The reason for choosing Routing protocol EIGRP was firstly it's very proper convergence time, secondly its easiness of configuration and troubleshooting over other routing protocols. But the reason for using the DMVPN approach is to create a tunnel for each branch with headquarter rather than a client / server approach. We do this by creating only one tunnel on the Headquarter router, and the Hub router establishes an NHRP table where the address information of all the branches is easily communicated between the branches (if necessary) and the headquarter with the branches. In the displayed configuration IP address hub: 172.16.0.1 and also the IP address hub: 172.16.0.1 branch 172.16.0.2 has been configured,the split-horizon feature was disabled using the no up split-horizon eigrp 1 command. IP MTU 1400 packet size of MTU 1400 configured. For authentication we used the "ip nhrp" authentication command and set the key to "dmvpn". It should be noted that the key in both hub and spoke must be the same. In the DMVPN configuration, using the bandwidth and delay commands which these two items are used in the EIGRP metric calculation we set them manually, and also set the nhrp server address in the branches using the "ip nhrp nhs" command. We used the "ip nhrp holdtome" command in the headquarter and in the branches to adjust when NHRP dynamics inputs expire. We can use the "show ip nhrp" command on the Hub router to monitor the established tunnels and we can clear the NHRP table contents with the clear "ip nhrp" command.</p>

							<p>Given that the project was very large in scale, many of the comments and suggestions came from the consultation of all members during design and implementation, but some of the suggestions that I made were as follows:</p>
							<ul class="list10">
							<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Suggestion to use a cisco 878 router for branches were approved in the project workgroup.</li>
							<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Suggestion to use the cisco 7200 router for the headquarters were approved in the project workgroup.</li>
							<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Suggestion to use of the PLS platform for communication between the Branches and the Central Branch were approved in the Project Working Group.</li>
							<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Suggestion to use the Internet as a backup link that was not approved in the project workgroup.</li>
							<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Suggestion to use of DMVPN which were approved in the project working group.</li>
							</ul>
							<p><b>4.2. Assess the overall success or failure of the project.</b></p>
							<p>Imagine an organization where all of its branches are connected to central branch servers via VPN connection with different bandwidths and always have problems such as expiring VPN password, slow internet connection, etc., but by implementing a comprehensive project through a Client / Server solution, they are permanently connected to the headquarters and on the other hand information security is enhanced using the secure MPLS platform. Another important point is that the internal branch network was integrated with Cisco switches and this is just a tip of an iceberg in the amount of actions taken in this project, considering the implications of the project implementation, the result of the Implementation of the projects were considered very successful by the managers of the organization.</p>
							<p><b>4.3. Lessons Learned</b></p>
							<p>In retrospect, what you might have done differently on this project?</p>
							<p>When a project is successfully implemented on this scale, all the focus is usually on project success. But a step-by-step review of the design steps until project implementation reveals some of the weaknesses. Among these weaknesses, in my opinion, was the lack of use of modern project planning tools such as the Microsoft MS project to determine the tasks and timing of each task, and most importantly the task of executing that task, which had problems in organizing the project. Certainly if a similar project is to be implemented in the organization, I would suggest using this tool. Another problem was the lack of justification of the branch network experts of the organization, we had to justify the branch network experts in the implementation of the project and their tasks prior to the project implementation.</p>
							<p>Another issue may be considered was, we could use programming tools such as Python, which have recently become very popular in Cisco Devices Configuration, in configuring routers and switches in branches, which not only save project implementation time, but also reduced the human faults and errors in implementation.</p>

					<p><b>5.5. Describe your role(s) and responsibilities in the project.</b></p>
					<p>Due to my work experience and the fact that I have implemented several accounting projects in recent years, I was given the responsibility of implementing this project by the technical management of the organization. I participated in this project in addition to studying and analyzing the applicable software and hardware and software solutions, selecting and purchasing hardware, configuring the firewall and performing technical tests and final project implementation. I made the final report and provided technical management.</p>
					<p><b>6. Business Opportunity or Problem</b></p>
					<p><b>6.1. Describe the business opportunity or problem(s) this project addressed.</b></p>
					<p>One of the problems with our organization due to the large number of users was the issue of Internet usage management. Prior to the implementation of this project, there was no mechanism to manage the Internet in our company. In addition, there was no mechanism to limit the time of Internet use. These problems led to a public demand in the creation of an Internet management mechanism in the organization. Considering the above-mentioned points, technical management has been dedicated to me with the responsibility of choosing and purchasing the right hardware and creating the right mechanism to manage consumption and Internet connectivity.</p>
					<p><b>7. Solution</b></p>
					<p><b>7.1. Discuss your contribution to the solution, project or engagement.</b></p>
					<p>Due to my responsibility in the implementation of the project, I was involved in various stages of project implementation: In the first phase, while studying various devices with other members of the team and with the approval of the technical director, we chose cyberoam 200ing, as well as partnering with the other team members, we launched configuration of Cyberoam 200 ing, cisco ACS and Active directory software, and then contributed to launching a new accounting trial, and after assuring proper system performance with other team members and technical director approval, I participated in the final implementation, and then By the end of the project I finished the project by editing the project report and presenting it to the technical manager.</p>
					<p><b>7.2. Describe any design or problem solving methods you used on this project.</b></p>

					<p><b>7.3. List the major deliverables of the project that you were responsible for or contributed to.</b></p>
					<p>My most important activities in this project included:</p>
					<ul class="list10">
					<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Studying applicable solutions</li>
					<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Selecting the Cyberoam 200ing firewall as the accounting solution</li>
					<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Cyberoam firewall configuration</li>

					</ul>

					<p><b>8. Results</b></p>
					<p><b>8.1. Was your solution implemented? If so, describe the role, if any, you had in the implementation.</b></p>
					<p>During the project implementation, I came up with a number of solutions, taking into account that I was responsible for the project implementation:</p>
					<ul class="list10">
					<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>I suggested using Cyberoam 200ing with respect to Throughput and appropriate support, which was approved in the project workgroup.</li>
					<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>I proposed to check the incoming and outgoing Internet traffic using IPS / IDS capability, which was approved by the project team.</li>
					<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>I suggested creating different user groups based on the allocated bandwidth, the usable internet volume, and the allowed internet connection time, which were approved by the project team.</li>
					<li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>I suggested using the organization's existing Active Directory features for Internet authentication, which were approved in the project workgroup.</li>
					</ul>

					<p><b>8.2. Assess the overall success or failure of the project.</b></p>
					<p>The biggest achievement of this project was a major change in the company's Internet management. Because before the implementation of this solution, despite the high bandwidth purchased from the Internet service provider, this bandwidth was often filled and users had trouble in declining of speed to access to the Internet. On the other hand, by launching IPS / IDS capabilities into the Cyberoam firewall, inbound and outbound traffic were carefully inspected by the firewall. Another achievement of this project was the implementation of the project in a short period of time. However, the result of the project implementation was approved by the technical manager.</p>
					<p><b>8.3. Lessons Learned</b></p>
					<h2>In retrospect, what you might have done differently on this project?</h2>
					<p>If I want to implement this project again, I will definitely be looking more positively before choosing the option of some cheaper devices like Mikrotik before choosing the solution, since I have recently realized this is widely used in my country. Or I am considering some software features like kerio. Perhaps the biggest reason for this is that buying licenses for cyberoam in my country is difficult. However, these two solutions do not require a license. I also want to increase the reliability of the service by purchasing two firewalls and running them either active / active or active / passive.</p>
