                                  <p>Myself being a Software Developer & Application Developer, foremost part of my job is working for a project as a team. In my tenure as Developer Programmer I have worked on plentiful application development and have been dealing with team colleagues from multiple company departments.</p>
                                  
                                  <p>I strictly adhere to below work principles. These have always provided me with eternal success</p>
                                  
                                  <ul class=" wewre">
                                    <li>1: I perfectly understand my position/standing in the project team and comprehend with the shared goal.</li>
                                    <li>2: I recognize the fact that project team members must have identical goal.</li>
                                    <li>3: I permanently appreciate steady communiqué with individuals having likewise interest.</li>
                                    <li>4: I sturdily trust team-work at all times concludes positive outcome.</li>

                                  <p>I feel contended when working as part of the project team with my team colleagues even in case when I am the lead developer programmer of the project. Team members are the prime point of this position and working with multiple associates from diverse departments is also a challenging job. Usually departments setup units for performing dedicated jobs. When working with people from multiple department the problem is that everyone has different approach for solving the issues. Their angle of establishing solution is different. As a team lead developer programmer, I have learned how to be flexible enough to understand the thinking angles of multiple people and how to have seamless communication with them to have proper solution for issues and snags. I have been managing teams of 15 to 20 people and have solved multiple communication error issues during problem handling. I am well known in my companies where I have served as a lead programmer.</p>

                                  <p>Communiqué is constantly substantial in all walks of life. It’s very needful to have proper communication in Information Technology industry. The reason is that when start a project we need to have solid communication with client for their needs, empathizing with them for their new application. I believe that healthy communication solves all the snags and glitches.</p>
                                  
                                  <p>As a profound developer programmer, I have gained expertise in communication skills. I have been training the clients and project associates. This duty is perfectly performed by me in my company.</p>
                                  <p>Currently I have been accountable for project documentation, end user training and for entire communication amid company and the client.</p>
