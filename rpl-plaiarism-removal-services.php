              <p>A strict eye on Plagiarism is one of the primary duties of the Australian Computer Society (ACS) and therefore, detection and removal of Plagiarism is crucial to avoid rejection of RPL. </p>
              <p>The internet provides a high resource of online samples related to RPL, which are to be used for reference purpose only and nothing apart from that. Copying of RPL from the online samples hinders your individuality and portrays you to be someone else. </p>
              <p>Directly copying from the samples present online will make your RPL reports liable to easy rejection as ACS can easily find it out. The ACS skills assessment rejection rate is increased by the use of Plagiarism reports, as they highlight the copied content and shows the similarity percentage that can be associated with the report, which leaves no room for challenge and struggle. </p>
              <p>In order to avoid consequences of plagiarism and rejection, we suggest you seek professional assistance from organizations like MyCDRHelp. Uniqueness and authenticity of reports hold the key to ensure better results and selection by ACS. </p>
