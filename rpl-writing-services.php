					<p>The occupations that require an applicant to apply for ACS skill assessment include:</p>
					<h4>Eligibility Criteria</h4>
					<p>The criterion is different for each occupation and it is majorly based on the educational background as well as the work experience.</p>
					<ol class="list10">
					    <li class="df1"><b>Temporary Graduate</b>
					    <p>Applicants must have an Australian Bachelor Degree or higher. The degree has to be an ICT major or strictly relevant to your nominated occupation. The applicants don't need to have worked in the selected field. </p>
					    </li>
					    <li class="df1"><b>Post Australian Study Skills Assessment</b>
					    <p>Applicants are required to have an Australian Bachelor Degree or higher. The qualification has to be an ICT major and highly relevant to your nominated occupation. You must also have a related post-study work experience of 1 year or complete the ACS Professional Year Program.</p>
					    </li>
					    <li class="df1"><b>Skills</b>
					        <ol class="list10">
					            <li class="df1">If you possess a Bachelor's degree or higher, and are relevant to your occupation as an ICT major, you must show relevant work experience of 2 years in the last 10 years or 4 years of relevant work experience in the past.</li>
					            <li class="df1">If you have a Bachelor's degree or higher that is not relevant to your occupation as an ICT major, you are required to show 4 years of related work experience in the past.</li>
					            <li class="df1">If you possess a Bachelor's degree or higher closely relevant to your occupation as an ICT major, you must show 5 years of related work experience in the past 10 years or related work experience of 6 years in the past.</li>
					            <li class="df1">If you possess a Bachelor's degree or higher degree in an ICT minor not related to your occupation, you are required to show at least 6 years of relevant work experience in the past.</li>
					            <li class="df1">If you hold a Diploma, Advanced Diploma, or Associate Degree and your occupation in an ICT major is related to your qualification, you must show proof of work experience of 5 years done in the last 10 years or relevant work experience of 6 years anytime in the past.</li>
					            <li class="df1">If you hold a Diploma, Advanced Diploma, or Associate Degree and if it is not related to your occupation, and it is an ICT major, you just need to show a relevant work experience of 6 years anytime in the past.</li>
					        </ol>
					    </li>
					    <li class="df1"><b>RPL</b>
					    <ol class="list10">
					        <li class="df1">Applicants with a non-ICT Diploma or higher can show 6 years of relevant work experience along with a successful RPL application.</li>

					    </ol>
					    </li>
					</ol>
					<h4>ICT Major Vs ICT Minor</h4>
					<p>The applicant with a Bachelor's degree or higher must have at least completed 33% of your studies in computing, in an ICT Major. For applicants with Diploma, Advanced Diploma or Associated Degree, they must have completed at least 50% of the classes in computing in an ICT Major. Those with a Bachelor's degree or higher qualification will be assessed as an ICT Minor if the computing content is 2/3 of the requirements for a major.</p>
					<h4>Work Experience</h4>
					<p>For applicants to be eligible, the employment must meet the below-listed criteria: </p>
					<ul class="list10">
					    <li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>You must have done work for at least 20 hours per week.</li>
					    <li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>You must have attained remuneration for your work.</li>
					    <li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Your employment must have been done post your qualification.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Thus, any research work or volunteering based on the thesis will not be considered as work experience. </p>
					<h4>What documents do you need to apply for an ACS skills assessment?</h4>
					<p>Other than identifying documents, you must provide documents that prove your qualifications and work experience. ACS has listed strict standards on the details that must be included in the work reference letter. Your employment reference letter must include documents like: </p>
					<ul class="list10">
					    <li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Start and finish of employment date (DD/MM/YYYY)</li>

					<ul class="list10">
					    <li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Official government tax records</li>

					    <li class="df1"><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Employment linked with insurance or superannuation</li>
					</ul>
					<h4>What happens if you cannot provide the relevant work reference letter?</h4>
					<p>In cases where applicants failed to provide the work reference letter from their employer for reasons like the company has ceased operation. In this case, ACS accepts documents like a statutory declaration or an affidavit. However, applicants are required to explain the reason why an employment reference letter cannot be provided. </p>
					<h4>Costs and Processing Times</h4>
					<p>The processing times for skill assessment take at least 8-10 weeks to be completed. However, if ACS asks for additional documents, the standard processing time will take a little longer to complete the process. </p>

                    <h3>Work experience only- Recognition of Prior learning assessment</h3>
                    <p>You may need to present additional 2 years of work experience as ICT skilled employee (8 years in total) if you do not have relevant tertiary qualifications. However, the additional qualifications need not be relevant with ANZSCO code or even an RPL report for the same is not required. </p>
                    <p>Here, the RPL report is of quintessential importance, for which expert help is suggested to avoid the hassle of rejection. Hence, to avoid the hassle of rejection and presenting error free reports, consult our experts at MyCDRHelp.com .</p>
                    <p>Recognition of Prior Learning is an assessment of skills of an individual who don’t have ICT Qualifications or any of the tertiary ICT qualification but has adequate ICT related experience.
