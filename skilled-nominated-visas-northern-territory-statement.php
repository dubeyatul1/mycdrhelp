                <p>So, with all the prospects for nomination, what are the aspects of being nominated by the NT Government?</p>
                <p>Well, the NT Government can make a choice to nominate you only if the occupation you are showing interest in listed on the <strong>NT Migration Occupation List</strong></p>
                
                <p>There is also a chance of nomination on the basis of the occupations listed on Australian Governmentâ€™s current list of eligible skilled occupations and based on the below aspects:</p>
