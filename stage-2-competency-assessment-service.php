              <p>As stated by Engineers Australia, Chartered status is a certification of personal engineering competency. Chartered Professionals are expected to have reached the highest level of professional competence in the concerned domain, through years of experience and practice.</p>
              <p>The Stage-2 competency assessments or standard of charter indicates to certification on personal engineering competency. A Chartered Engineering Professional is always deemed to attain the highest level of professionalism through continuous practice. To get registered as a Chattered Professional Engineer by Engineers Australia, one needs to demonstrate engineering competency in areas such as leadership, expertise, quality and safety.</p>
              <p>The experts from MyCDRHelp.com have completed many successful stage 2 competency claim documents with 100% success rate till date. Some of the documents such as CDR and CV need to submit previously for seeking stage 2 competency claims. Sometimes additional questions are also asked for gaining more experience after CDR submission. If anybody does not submit CDR then they are being asked few extra questions related to professional experience and write a stronger claim. </p>

					   <h3>WRITING ENGINEERING COMPETENCY CLAIMS</h3>
					   <h4 class="kao">About the Competencies</h4>
					   <p>The 2012 Australian Engineering Competency Standards Stage 2 has stated three major occupational categories, which are Engineering Associate, Engineering Technologist, and Professional Engineer. Each of these categories consist sixteen elements of competence which is further divided into four different principal units:</p>
					   <p>- Personal commitment</p>
					   <p>- Value in the workplace</p>
					   <p>- Obligation to community</p>
					   <p>- Technical proficiency</p>
					   <p>Each element of competence provides multiple indicators of attainment that serves as a guide to the engineering work likely to be considered as demonstrating attainment of that competence</p>
					   <p>Applicants are required to prepare an Engineering Competency Claim (ECC) for all the competency standards. You need to prove your competence in each practise area you are seeking registration or chartered in. Prepare an account of your plan of actions and decisions taken for each ECC in any individually verified episodes of engineering, including evidence of your personal competence in the element you picked. You must remember, all these actions need to be verifiable, specific and actual not just statements that include generic principles or behaviour.</p>
					   <p>The evidence you will write must be enough to showcase your competence for a particular ECC in all aspects of ‘what this element means in practice’ (as mentioned in the 2nd column of the tables in the Stage 2 Competency Standards applicable to your occupational category).</p>
					   <p>The Stage 2 Competency Standards mention the Indicators of Attainment for each element (provided in the 3rd column of the tables). These elements majorly serve as a guide related to your engineering work, which demonstrates your competence in any particular element.</p>
					   <p>When it comes to Engineering Problems & Engineering Activities, you must mention personal experience that consist of some or all the characteristics of the related Engineering activities and Engineering problems, as stated in the Stage 2 Competency Standards.</p>
					   <p class="cenb"><i>You must present 3 strong evidences referenced in each of the competency as well as the answers to back up how you achieve the competency with the task carried out during the projects.</i></p>
					   <h3>2- Writing ECCs</h3>
					   <h4 class="kao"> 2.1 Preparation</h4>
					   <p>You develop your capability (competence) through experience and interactions with others. Hark back to your career to date and pen down five of six episodes that helped you grow and which you made significant contributions to.</p>
					   <p>Make your notes as detailed as the descriptions of engineering activities and engineering problems in the Stage 2 Competency Standards.</p>
					   <p>These notes can be created with the help of the material you have contributed to, such as proposals, design reports, specifications, project appraisals, and your resume. Recognize others' contributions and distinguish contributions you believe you made as a result of discussions or collaboration with others. At this point, you should expect your notes to be three or four pages long. Print it and be prepared to make notes on it.</p>
					   <p>Now consider the skills you used in each of these career episodes. At this stage, you should go over the sixteen Elements of Competence. Refer to the Attainment Indicators, as they help you understand the scope anticipated in the corresponding Element. Make a note on your printout for each Element where you believe you have applied the capability described in "what this competence means in practice."</p>
					   <p>Some Elements will be apparent where exactly you have used that capability. In comparison, others may not be very clear. You may discover that you have used certain Elements in all or most of your career episodes. Other Elements may or may not have a showing. If the latter is the case, return to "getting started" and add a career episode in which you used the missing capability.</p>
					   <p>At this stage, choose the experience from your career episodes that best demonstrates your capability in each Element. Choose Wisely! This experience from your career episodes, in particular, will influence the assessors that you have achieved proficiency; that you can practice without supervision, and can assist others in developing this capability.</p>
					   <p>When choosing work experience to provide as evidence of competence, choose contributions to work that have some or all of the characteristics of engineering problems or engineering activities as determined in the competency standard for your occupational category. The following scenarios are provided to help you begin your thinking process.</p>
					   <p class="cenb"><i>"In the new Engineers Australia requirement, all individual attributes within 16 competencies must be addressed. (This is not the same as the previous stage 2). Each competency must have at least three projects referenced, each with an explanation of how the competency was achieved through the work completed/referred to."</i></p>
					   <h4 class="kao"> 2.2 Writing the Claim</h4>
					   <p>Always try to ensure you write the evidence within 700 words per element.</p>
					   <p>Applicants must write credibly proving your abilities contributed to your engineering activity or engineering problem that demonstrate your proficiency in each of the elements of competence.</p>
					   <p>Use active voice and first person like I researched, I did etc. Explain things with utmost precision like what you did, why you did it and how.</p>
					   <p>Make sure that you use the correct grammar and sentences that are well-framed and easy to understand. To list activities, don’t forget to use dot points. Be very clear when explaining any technical terms. Avoid using jargon and make sure the details are verifiable and not hypothetical.</p>
					   <p>Remember that mentioning contributions in any project, program or progress can help you cover various elements. You can even pick a particular career episode to showcase more than one of the elements and make sure you prepare separate narratives for a particular element. Each of these narratives must demonstrate your contribution and your capability in the project. Use can also use examples in each narrative. Mention at least five to six career episodes across the elements.</p>
					   <p>Your ECC must be of 500 words to provide the sufficient evidence, and to prove that you have the relevant competence. Do not just write to meet the word count alone; pay equal attention to provide the sufficient evidence as well as submit enough episodes with relevant material. The official word counter in the eChartered available at the bottom of the claim text box will do the word count for you.</p>
					   <p>Give a brief introduction for each ECC and it must include dates as well as context in which you will prove your claimed competence. Explain your contribution in the project rather than writing just about the project or what the team contributed to accomplish it. Use the correct grammar and write in active voice and in the first person.</p>

                       <div class="col-sm-12 pd">
					   <h4 class="kao">Finally, ask yourself this question:</h4>
					   <p class="cenb">Before submitting, ask yourself a question, “Is whatever you have written good enough to prove your competence?” You can also take advice from the experts. You can also use the assessment principles given below:</p>
					   <p><b>- Is it Authentic?</b></p>
					   <p>It must be authentic and explain and prove your personal competency, rather the competence of anyone in the team.</p>
					   <p><b>- Is it Valid?</b></p>
					   <p>It must claim and demonstrate the adequate evidence of the competence proving your abilities in solving any specific situation or problem. Whatever you write should be from your professional experience, not just any hypothetical situation.</p>
					   <p><b>- Is it Reliable?</b></p>
					   <p>You must mention the evidence that proves your credibility against the selected competence and it must be reliable. Do you just write the outcome but write how you accomplish the task? </p>
					   <p><b>- Is it Current?</b></p>
					   <p>You must demonstrate that you are currently competent in the chosen element of competency. Keep in mind that the more recent your evidence is, the more chances you have to prove your competency so make sure the evidence is the latest. Your work experience of the past 8 years should be sufficient to prove all your 16 elements of competence. You can also contact the Assessor if you decide to use the evidence of the past 10 years to know if the experience would be right to use to demonstrate as evidence of your competence.</p>
					   <p><b>- Is it Sufficient?</b></p>
					   <p>It must include enough evidence for the successful assessment of your competence in your occupational category along with the engineering problems and activities that you have dealt with. Make sure you successfully address every aspect of your competence to demonstrate your credibility.</p>
					   <p class="cenb">If the answer is ‘yes’, submit the ECC for verification and assessment.</p>
					   <p>Writing a significant career episode can help you provide the evidence of your competence in several Elements. However, when you claim for all 16 Elements of Competence, the Assessors at EA expect you to provide at least three separate work examples.</p>

                      <h3>Chartered Competency Assessment Pathways</h3>
                      <p>To get recognition as a Chattered Engineer in Australia, Engineers Australia directs one to choose an appropriate Chartered Competency Assessment pathway from four available options. Below are the four EA’s Chartered Competency Assessment pathways: </p>
                      <p><b>The assessment pathway divided into four paths -</b></p>
                      <ul class="list10">
                      <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Professional Development Program or PDP</li>
                      <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Engineering Competency Report or ECR</li>
                      <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Mature Experienced Engineer or MEE </li>
                      <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Mutual Recognition Agreement or MRA</li>
                      </ul> 
                      <p>Whichever the Chartered pathway chosen, the engineer seeking the Chartered Status recognition will be asked to submit a number of documents/items. There are two different courses. It is required to mention these in a conspicuous manner. Course 1 provides information about PDP, and it denotes the Professional Development Programme. Course 2 is responsible for providing information about the ECR or Engineering Competency Report. Course 3 is quite efficient to provide knowledge about MEE. Course4 is used to develop performances about MRA.</p>
                      <p>The chartered course is mentioned to provide information about the chartered status. It is necessary to recognize the required documents for the completion of the submission processes. It is necessary to give information on the provided documents. Australian Engineers used these types of documents to make evidence for engineering competency.  It is necessary to discuss four different submission processes.<br/><b>These valuable document submission processes are -</b></p>
                      <ul  class="list10">
                      <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> ECCs or “Engineering Competency Claims”</li>
                      <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> EER or “Engineering Experience Record”</li>
                      <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> UP to date CV</li>
                      <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> CPD record, it denotes as Continuing Professional Development process."</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>As per these types of the submission process, an uncharted course varies between 11 to 16 valuable elements. ECC provides information about the personal experiences of engineering knowledge. These methods are also necessary to develop the technical skills or technical process. Australian engineering skills or performances are mainly depended on a few important factors.<br/><b> These valuable factors are -</b></p>
                      <ul  class="list10">
                      <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Personal commitment. It is an essential actor to describe information about the Australian engineering efficiencies.</li>
                      <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> The demonstration, without proper demonstration it would be impossible to understand the efficiencies of the workplace. This element is also used to gather knowledge about the element codes and core codes.</li>
                      <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> A clear demonstration is also necessary to identify technological efficiencies in the workplace.</li>
                      <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> The obligation is also required to make a community of all efficient engineers.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>Some efficient consultant from its background has the capabilities to assist in CPEng registration process. It maintains its efficiencies to prepare ECC, experience record and other types of valuable documents.</p>
                      <h3>Engineering competency claim</h3>
                      <p>It is dependable on the charter pathway. Selected engineer’s numbers are as variable 11 to 16. Generally who comes from engineering competency report or ECR needs to submit 16 engineering competency claims. Each of the claims explains personal engineering involvement in a detailed manner. This competency claims developed based on a few elements that are thoroughly explained incompetency standard published by Australia. </p>

                        <p>Each of the units develops by some common elements that indicate competency attainment. It properly guides engineers in increasing their capabilities and demonstrate attainment incompetence level.</p>
                        <h3>Engineering Experience Record (EER)</h3>
                        <p>This is a short description of the job role and employment criteria within 700 words. Princess of the adobe application process is time taking and too much complicated. However, people can easily apply through background knowledge on specific requirements.</p>
                        <h3>Structure of the Stage 2 Standard</h3>
                        <p>The assessment for stage 2 is separated into two major parts these are -</p>
                        <h3>Part A: The Competencies</h3>
                        <p>In some core areas 14 units belonging in it. Three of them are core units and applicable for every area in engineering practice. The other 11 are elective units. Two of the elective units are suitable for any specific area and common practice selected by the applicants. These units are listed below:</p>
                        <ul class="list10">
                        <li><i class="fas fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Strong</li>

                        </ul> 
                        <p>According to the overall analysis, it can be mentioned that each of the assessment needs to be properly conducted by each of the members in stage 2 competencies and chosen occupational category. Along with that, it can be said that it helps in demonstrating the personal views of every member. </p>
                        <h4 class="kao">Intricacies of Stage 2 Competency Report</h4>
                        <p>In the initial stage, engineers should be complete all the information regarding their occupational experience, project handling and other terms of proper matter. There are some all-important critical terms including passport-style photos, Curriculum Vitae. I along with that person need to mention the title of the job and person roles and responsibility. The assigned interest in the report needs to be appropriately conducted to the user such as Engineers of Australia. The final report needs to be improved most of the times and syntactic misconducts should be corrected. The reports need to be plagiarism free also.</p>
                        <h4 class="kao">E charter competency assessment pathway</h4>
                        <p>To become a successful chartered engineer in Australia, engineers are required to select an appropriate e charter competency pathway form four available options. In below four of the chartered competency pathway has been properly addressed. Pathway 1 refers to Professional Development Program or PDP</p>
                        <p>Pathway2 indicates Engineering Competency Report or ECR</p>
                        <p>Pathway 3 Mature Experienced Engineer or MEE and pathway 4 indicate to Mutual Recognition Agreement or MRA. </p>
                        <p>After selecting a proper e-commerce charter the engineers are seeking actual status recognition and submit all the required documents within time. The major four submission items are:</p>
                        <p>ECCs, EER, CPD record and an updated CV </p>
                        <p>Depending on the eCharterd pathway selected number of engineers claims (ECC) will vary 11 and 16. Based on stage, 2 competency levels always published by set the engineers.<br/><b> The stage 2 competency standard describes some of the special indicators these are -</b></p>

                <p>There are several elements of contents in most of the units. It also includes some series of activities, results capable of management. The presentation of elements can be measured through element demonstration of individual elements. This action generally calls the definition of activities. For example, a significant property can be demonstrated by showing candidates' successful performance. A Core Unit can be confirmed by showing all Details within the Unit by the applicants. An Optional Unit can be proved by demonstrating the designated Parts within the Unit. </p>
                <p>The terms in this assessment help to measures the personal requirement for the task. Engineers need special practical knowledge for effectively completing all the tasks. Moreover, it can be said that the recruiter also judges individual people according to their competency level. </p>
                <h3>Part B: The Standards</h3>
                <p>The occupational category has some of the separated standards. The descriptions are also discriminated through roles and reflected standards. </p>
                <p>Professional engineers are conducting for most far-reaching strategy in any engineering project. The major task of this segment is to develop some possible solutions based on the present g technical and non-technical project constraints. It also helps in project risk management. </p>
                <p>Engineering technologists have completed some theoretical specialization on specific engineering branches such an application adoption and management. In various contexts, they take part in project management.</p>
                <p>Engineering associates: they are skilful in the practical application of engineering work. In addition, they also watch over the purpose of acceptance criteria and codes of conduct in common as well as different forms. The standard of the assessment helps to follow the personal competency level effectively.</p>
                <h4 class="kao">Assessment against the Stage 2 Standards</h4>
                <p>The method begins by asking the applicants to use for evaluation in the professional category that they think will pleasantly show their abilities, knowledge, and accomplishments.</p>
                <p>Stage 1 competency has been confirmed by the applicant through authorized or sanctioned eligibility. On the other hand, if an applicant does not operate an approved or recognized criterion in the concerned section then that person applies for the assessment stage 1 first.</p>
                <p>In certain cases, it can be possible for taking part in stage1 and stage 2 assessment one after one. All the advice needs to borrow before the final proceedings. </p>
                <p>Several Units indicate Competency been described in Part A including three major units with two elective units. </p>
                <p>In addition, with that, it can be considered that candidates are not always demonstrated units of standards and personal categorisation in part B assessment. </p>
                <p>The occupational category has been demonstrated in the below format in each of the units </p>
                <p>Stage 2 competency standards are meant for experienced engineers who are willing to migrate out of their respective country. It is a way of testing an engineers ability to express his knowledge and skills and showcase his abilities, values and attitudes. Stage 2 competency assessment is conducted to acquire Charted Membership of Engineers Australia (CPEng) and get your name registered on the national engineering register (NER). </p>
                <p>The assessment is conducted by Engineers Australia to test engineers capabilities under different areas like practical application, knowledge and skills. The candidates have to prepare an effective stage 2 competency report to demonstrate their skills and get the recognized credential, CPEng. It is a widely recognized achievement and appreciated by governments, businesses and public if you get your name enrolled in the national engineering register. </p>
                <p>Your stage 2 competency assessment gets credited only when you have the qualities of a professional engineer and the ability to express them. <br/>Below are some of the presuppositions which are mutually agreed by the society to express you as a professional engineer. </p>
