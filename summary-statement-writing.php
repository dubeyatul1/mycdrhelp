					           <h3>What is a Summary statement writing?</h3>
                         <p>Essentially a Summary statement is a summation of your CDR report, and you have to prepare it in such a way that it is understood with one glance by the EA so that they do not have to go through the entire report and can find out what they are looking for easily. For this, you must provide cross-references of the paragraphs that is written in each career episode. For all the three episodes, only a single summary statement is required.</p>
                         <p>While writing the Summary statement, you should be careful to mention all your achievements and information and connect them to the appropriate episodes in the CDR section. This would provide you with a successful and complete well-spun Summary statement. It is an initial step in having a promising profession in any specialized institution.</p>
                         <p>A summary statement is part of a CDR report which ahs to be submitted to the Engineers Australia (EA) for an assessment of the engineering skills. It is written in a tabular format where the competency elements are listed and have to be well-connected to the episodes in the CDR.</p>
                         <p>There are at present four categories according to which Engineers can prepare their CDR which is: Professional Engineer, Engineering Manager, Engineering Associate, Engineering Technologist. The template prescribed by EA for all four categories is different, and it has to be written according to the format chosen.</p>
