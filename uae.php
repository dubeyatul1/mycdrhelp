              <h3>Reasons Why Engineers from UAE Prefer Our Services!</h3>
                  <p>Many engineering graduates and professional engineers from UAE want to settle in different countries of the world. The main reason is to get better work opportunities and facilities. In most of the cases, it has been noticed that they want to migrate to Australia and New Zealand.</p>
                  <p>Suppose you are planned to migrate to these countries, you need to show your knowledge and skills using a CDR (Competency Demonstration Report), RPL (Recognition of Prior Learning) or KA02 (Knowledge Assessment) report. Each of these things has specific instructions on which engineers have to prepare their report without making any mistakes. Remember that a lack of understanding of the guidelines can lead to errors in the report. And, this could be the main reason to get rejected during the assessment.</p>
                  <p>Nothing to worry about when you have the professional support of our team! With the knowledge and experience what our experts share, it is sufficient enough to provide you with commendable reports. Starting from the good quality English writing to well-structured report, we fill all the necessary parameters to guarantee your selection. It is evident that our reports have the approval rate of at most 99% when you want to get a job in Australia and New Zealand. You have to share the correct details regarding your skills and we will do the rest.</p>
                  <p>Since we have expert writers who have adequate knowledge of the guidelines related to CDR and other necessary reports, it will become a simple task. Once you hire us, you can spend your valuable time performing your duties without having a second thought. We will make sure that your Summary Statements and Career Episodes contain the accurate material for the selection. However, you must take a revision of the report and get accustomed to it.</p>

                   <h3>Reasons of CDR rejection</h3>
                     <p><b>1. Plagiarized content</b></p>
                     <p>There are very high chances that your submitted CDR or KA02 gets rejected because it contains content which is considered as plagiarized. It may be possible that you copy the content from a sample which already exists or from another CDR. Also, it may be possible that you accidently end up becoming a culprit of it. Make sure that you hire us for a high quality and plagiarism free report. This is possible because we use advanced software to check for plagiarism in each and every sentence of a document. </p>
                     <p><b>2. Error in content</b></p>
                     <p>If your report contains some grammatical error or any other error and the EA authorities detect it, your CDR will get rejected. Submitting an error free report is very important to avoid rejection.</p>
                     <p><b>3. Improper format</b></p>
                     <p>There is a proper format which you are required to follow. If there is a mistake in making the report in the prescribed format, your KA02 is very likely to be rejected.

                     <p>The reports are to be written in a specific word limit. As already discussed, this word limit is prescribed very clearly in the guidelines. If you are not following the word limit, your CDR will get rejected. You don’t have to think about the word limit if you are hiring us for your help.</p>
                     <p><b>5. False information</b></p>

Make sure that the details which you are providing are true and are not at all false.
